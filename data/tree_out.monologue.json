  "name": "The following is a transcript of a conversation between the two famous neuroscientists Dr. Alfred and Dr. Bert. Dr. Alfred's primary interests is 'neural syntax', i.e., how segmentation of neural information is organized by the numerous brain rhythms to support cognitive functions. Dr. Bert studies the dynamics of small neuronal networks, and her work was instrumental in demonstrating that neuronal circuits are not 'hard-wired' but can be reconfigured by neuromodulatory neurons and substances to produce a variety of outputs. The two are having a casual academic conversation about the function of the higher-order-cortex.\n-BEGIN TRANSCRIPT-\n",

What I'm suggesting is that the short paths through the brain are often found by following local topographic connections, local connectivity, local dynamics.

And they make a lot of those decisions at the same time. They don't just ask the hippocampus, 'Can you do this? Can you do that? Can you give me a map?' They don't worry about the navigation problem. They're concerned about making right decisions. The hippocampus doesn't make right or wrong decisions, the hippocampus simply takes the directions provided by the entorhination grid cells and compares them with the internal representation that defines navigation. Then sends out outputs. For instance, when you run into a wall, the hippocampal map is not accurate, and it sends out wrong directions. This is what called off-map navigation.'"

As you know, for example, some neurons are active in the auditory cortex when a sound is played. This may, in principle, be computed as an input-output combination of a sound and a spike. However, there are other ways of processing, maybe for instance, visual signals. And again, there are many ways of processing of vision. And so if an output in the auditory cortex would be a fundamental requirement for an associational area, it is hard to imagine that the association area is useful in the eyesight. And it's important to remember that when you associate a feature, you must be able to classify it in order to do so.

It must be a function that has, in principle, the same output for, say, a picture of a cat or of a banana, or of a human face.

In fact, we go through a very long developmental series in the brain from simple objects (as your first baby would identify) to places (as my first kid would), to places and people, to larger and larger contexts all the way up to, finally, we arrive at the idea of a space, a context, an episode, and then how space, context and episode can be related.

So, um, therefore you've got multiple associations.  And that's very different from saying that you can combine the associative items into a set of items and that these associative items all have to refer to distinct items and the set of items they refer to is somehow distinct from the other set of items with which they are associated, in other words, if the sets are discrete, which you would have to say is a distinct constellation of neurons in at least one brain structure.'",

The neurons do that, and they are triggered. So they would be the brain and they would be the, the engine. If we go further, I'll give your case some thought.

But if the brain is given a larger territory than the retina, then it can take advantage of the information contained in these peripheral areas and use it as a reference frame to compute all your other sensory perceptions.'",

So you can put your eyes behind your head and if the brain is only using visual information, it would say that your eye movements are useless; it works perfectly well without looking at anything. But if the entire cerebral cortex receives information from movement command areas, it can then use the signals from these areas to compute all your actions without even looking at anything, and therefore these association areas are called 'higher order'. When a higher order area becomes a higher order cortex, what you have is a single cortex that is acting both as an input system and as an output system, and if so the term association cortex becomes obsolete, but that doesn't mean the cortical information will stop being divided in many parallel processing streams.'",

It sounded so much nicer, and I found it interesting. After all, the areas that can sense eye movements, which are called visual association areas, have nothing to do whatsoever with vision. But how did the brain learn to relate eye movements to visual perception? What does it use to do that? Because when you are sitting in an aeroplane and your eyes are closed, but you can't help it, there are two small movements of the eyes that you cannot stop. So there are a little ovals in the middle and there's a small circle in the middle, and when you try to follow the change of the two simple shapes, you do so for tens of thousands of milliseconds before you can get rid of them.'",

One is how, how the brain, how the brain calculates the distance from an object. The distance between the, the, the cursor in the computer monitor and the computer mouse, and calculates its, its position from the mouse click. Another one is how it calculates when the mouse starts to move after it touches the, the, um, the mouse. And then there's a third one, um, where the, the brain calculates when is the mouse to move.

And these loops are not independent, you would never be able to do a computation or to explain to an intelligent being how to make a car, let's say, go around with a steering wheel. We can make anything with any steering, so when I think of the brain as a giant parallel loop, you understand that there is this very complex organization and a certain top-down orchestration.

That's the problem I have with the concept of function, is that there's no alternative, and it's really hard to say, okay, that happens to be the only function because that's just what it is. At the very least, in my mind, it has to have some other alternatives, as well, that it's doing something different, something else, just in case, should occur.

If the rat takes a particular direction in a maze, say left, then it fires when the rats head is to the left, but it does not respond when the rat turns right. Now the simple circuits of the hippocampus will respond to a particular direction only when the rats head remains in that direction. That's why they're called head-direction neurons. But in a higher-order-circuit, there's another circuit that can respond when the rat is on the periphery and the head is to the right.'",

There's two fundamental challenges, the obvious challenge is the separation of two quite different classes of functions in the mammalian cortex, one is sensory, one is motor. The motor cortex, there's no question that the primary function of this area should be sending motor commands out, and there is no question about that, I guess. The other one is the association area, which we only recently discovered. They have a quite different function, one is sensory-based, but the other is motor-based. What is the difference?

And we haven't found, and I certainly don't think we're ever going to find it. The reason is very simple, which is that there is no, because cortical function is not the product of some single function. It's the product of, it's a product of a number of functions, which are brought about by a number of cell types, which have a number of different specializations, which then, then have a number of specializations by a particular level of organization.

So here's the very brief version of my thinking. Just make no assumptions about the cortex, and we'll see that we have different thoughts, but we start from similar places, okay? So the important thing about the human brain is that it's organized to deal with problems. So this is what we are interested in, but when we're asking about the function of an area, we can try to guess. But if we go back and look very slowly at the evolution of this brain.'",

We are not getting into a huge variation from a very, very simple initial structure, and then slowly developing and developing, this is something that's important, that's what evolution should do, as opposed to some, like, rigid thing that cannot change.

In this animal, when you had a single visual search to be made, the visual cortical representation map of the associative cortex was quite complex. As a result, while you were doing a search in the visual cortex, you could see that the associative cortex of the rat was also engaged.

What you can do is to develop a four-dimensional structure.

You have all the layers of the cortex and you have all the regions and layers. But for the same reason, that you have a four-dimensional space, you can do a lot. You can go back in time, and that's what happens, when you get old. Then you have four-dimensional, you have a nice structure that you can pull up and say, \"There is an organization principle here\", which is sort of a natural sheet structure.'",

It's so much simplier to understand the functions of one-dimensional, two-dimensional and three-dimensional networks than three-dimensional networks with three-dimensional connectivity, but with two-dimensional sheets.

I didn't like it, so I never pursued it, and I think that's why there's very little in the world that's understood about what has been called the cerebral cortex in the past three generations, even after the tremendous strides we've made in understanding the organization of the cerebrum itself.'"

Now, whether they're called 'association areas', that's an old terminology, or not, there's not a single fundamental function. Now, these are good for doing one thing only which is combine information. So now we have a new element; add another one, add another one, and we have two. They can do that.

Now, by definition, associational areas are devoted for a particular function, and the function is the brain activity that has a lot of overlap with another function, such as navigation, for example. Now, what is the critical part of the hippocampus, the critical part of this region, that would allow the hippocampal region to be responsible for the computation that's used when animals get their bearings, for example?'",

This is the, this is the, it's the, it's really important for me to say. The thing that drives me absolutely crazy is this, that how we go from nothing to the world all of a, from no features to elements, from elements to words, and from words to, at this, to, to, and we get an order, a hierarchy, and then we have to be so careful to explain how they do, or we think they do.

Once you can demonstrate that something can function as a constituent, then you have all of these options, such as (c) what role it plays in the, in the function (sic).

And one of the reasons is because if you understand the anatomical connections, of the different cortical areas, then you can draw the lines, and connect the different areas and layers together. And because it is a small volume, and you'd like to have the whole thing fit into the, for instance, your hippocampus. So this is what we call brain-function mapping. So because it is small and limited in volume, it is easier perhaps to look at the, the, one area at a time and ask whether each area is a primary area or a secondarary area, an associational area, maybe, or what's the point? And how these areas are connected to each other, and then see the functional, functional consequences of the connectivity. I mean, that would be the approach you would just take, yes.

As you know, in the rat brain there's no real difference between the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex, and yet we can see the difference in the function of these structures. So what they do is they sort of divide the hippocampal region, making two different structures. One of them, which is called the dentate gyrus, you know, and the other one, which is called \"correlated to behavior but not to spatial behaviors\" or memory, or navigational behaviors. And what they found is these areas are pretty much dedicated to the same things. So in fact, if we can give them both the same task, then they'll have similar performance.'",

Well, those two sides can be easily segregated because the map will be different, but if we put the walls opposite to each other, this is a much more difficult situation. So you know, it's just the fact that the spatial map is generated locally.

With respect to route-based, our research has shown, using the way-finding task, that there is a fundamental difference, which I would describe it as fundamental, and which has implications for thinking about the human brain as well as that of small animals. One fundamental difference is that way-finding is solved in the rat by a hippocampus-dependent memory, whereas in humans, it is solved by a neocortex-dependent planning approach.

We're seeing that the theta rhythm varies, even in the same brain, even in very short time windows, but this theta rhythm is often referred to as the \"presta-tive\" theta pattern. The theta waves are often present in a specific part of the hippocampus, and the theta is often present in a subset of the pyramidal cells, in the same brain region. And theta, or theta oscillation is often present in other structures as well. And what I found out is that the oscillation has a very different mechanism in other brain regions.'",

That's my kind of view of the brain. That would be the basis of hierarchical operations. There are a hierarchy of many networks interconnected from very large to very small, right?

And what makes memory or information in the brain is the representation of sequential events. Now, the oscillation in the brain that I'm interested in specifically is the ripple oscillations. And the ripple oscillations, for example, in the hippocampus are the very unique network oscillations that control the flow of sequentially active neuron assemblies in the hippocampus by coordinating the activity of the three major neuronal subclasses in the CA1 region. And this is the mechanism that the hippocampus is being employed to extract information from the long sequences that we're representing. And then how are we getting the information back out?

And if you have three objects, in which those are not identical, your eye is going to notice the relationship between them, where they're dissimilar from one another, where they're similar to each other'. Therefore, what I would say is you need to have some additional information about the sequences in which the objects are embedded. But most of the time the brains default state is the same and what is important is the relations that occur.

I moved into physiology because in physiology I found the very small, just a couple of neurons, one, two, three, four. I wondered then, how a single neuron can make such an impact on its target cells, just by timing them. To make a difference, one neuron can affect so many others, and how different single neurons differ from each other.  And the answer was that that single neuron is a pacemaker, as is a single neuron in the limbic system. And that's pretty much what you think, right.'"

First of all, when it's a whole mouse, association areas are kind of useless.  As I'm sure you know, when you chop up the mouse brain in a certain way and put them in a Petri dish, all the areas in that dish are pretty much disconnected.  As soon as the brain of the mouse is just lying there in the Petri dish and you slice it, there aren't any longer any associations fields, because the neurons,  as they are in the mouse brain, have nothing to do with the outside world because they are kind of useless and don't really have any connections.

You know, the same situation.  If you know, for example, that your mouse is facing to the left when there is a wheel to the left, or right when there is a ring on the right, and maybe to the left, and so on, then there shouldn't be a problem with it. That's just a set of motor commands in which the brain is embedded to solve the task. And there is no need for any regions that are dedicated to associations at this phase, because there is only one kind of movement, so the brain can kind of solve anything that it has to do at any given time pretty much efficiently without interference from the association areas, as long the movement does not conflict, as long as there is no conflict, because what you want me to do that I'm already doing?

It just doesn't happen, so that's the kind of issue I want to go back to and discuss, is that.  Of course, we have the concept of a hierarchy as in brain networks.

For example, when you train all the neurons in the motor cortex to be, or when you train a new set of neurons by a movement, and then that new set of neurons will be, to some extent, pretty much dedicated to that motion forever after.  So it turns out that in most cases of behavioral training, those areas of the cortex that can be very efficiently used to perform a particular action have a permanent and rigid pattern.

It's one of the major things in the brain that's necessary for memory that is required in order for the brain to be as effective as possible.

So the hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells and interneurons, together with their excitatory-inhibitory connections, can produce sequences of three events in a single theta cycle in a short time window. It is a very simple rule. All you have to do is to connect these three neurons, or this group of three neurons, together in such a way that they produce an output in about two theta cycles. You have a sequence of three, as compared to, say, four different events, which can take several theta cycles.

So the relationship, in principle between the three neurons, rather than their relationship to theta oscillations is more important than their relationship to each other. There's a very special relationship between the three neurons that produces a very specific order. So that is what this special organization is for, but to some extent, sequences are important, because they can be generated by only three or few neuron types.

We can generate any sequence, but in practice, when we do that, the brains, which can easily be perturbed, doesn't allow us to do that. We have to go on a long series of different sequences that occur in different brain states. This is why they're so complex. They're so complex.'",

So, what do you think the associational areas do?'",

It may be that no one would ever have thought that, but as we thought more about it, it may be reasonable to think that one of the main things the associational areas are for is perhaps to provide stability and allow the brain to be more efficient. So, there needs to be some kind of a rule, I would think, that a cell in an associational area is going to have to fire when and in response the way that it fires in order to be considered meaningful. Or otherwise, there would be no way to tell that it was the same cell and that it responded the same to a particular constellation of inputs. It would be very hard to tell from the outside, you would be like a robot who wouldn't notice if the same cell responded to the same set of stimuli, but it would be much more efficient.' Dr.'",

Then in the same way, the primary function is something that when you want to explain behavior and function you can't do that. That has to be found in the internal world of the neuroscientists.

I'd call it a 'neural syntax' but most people would say a 'neural narrative' and we have to realize that the brain is a neural assembly and it is that simple.

And these two principles have opposing effects on the dynamic of a system. And as long as one of these two fundamental principles of the brain is... is kept in balance, then the network, or the system in question, would be called a'steady state'. And that's where things are the best. But what is an \"order parameter\"? Now, the order parameter is an indicator of the state of the system.

Like from the rhythm you try to look at special anatomical configurations that support that rhythm. And then start simplifying from there. In this case, the oscillator is the simplest thing to study, I think, really. It's a very fundamental element of the brain. But then you can go from there and build up a model of it.

It cannot generate output independently, which you can, for example, send it to the parietal cortex...and, in that case, the prefrontal cortex becomes the output device.

One is, if that's indeed the primary mechanism in virtually any species, that means what kind of inputs do you have to send in order to make the cortex respond? and the other one is, whether the input does really need to be an explicit input for the cortical network, for example, whether the input of a stimulus requires the participation of the highest order cerebral cortex in order to represent the stimulus.

The brain works that way. It's a resonant type of frequency oscillator. So, if there are two oscillations that have a common frequency, they can bring each other together and generate a higher frequency than their individual frequencies. But, of course, the important thing is that the two oscillations don't have to be synchronized, but they have to have a common frequency. So, as a result of this resonance and this coherent resonance interaction, the two rhythms either enhance each others phase and frequency or they just synchronize and then they can produce a higher frequency.'"

For example, if you have the following three inputs in the parietal cortex, there could be three different patterns. The simplest one, or the easy pattern, may be called the feedforward pattern. This is a typical input pattern, because feedforward is the direction of the connections and the shortest path. The information that is feed forwarded from the parietal cortex to the primary visual cortex.'",

Because it's the type of connection that is the best organized to go from the most distal brain areas, the higher order, all the way down to the primary sensory areas in the brain, via the thalamus.

What's even more surprising to me, is that it works for pretty much the same pattern of information, input patterns.

And in fact we just published in Nature these last few weeks, one of the first reports which has examined the output, output functions of brain-machine interface.

And pattern completion is just comparing the present situation to a stored trace of the situation. And that stored trace is called the'representa-tion' of the present situation by the hippocampus.

The whole computation is to predict what is the best prediction among a small number of predictions for the given signal. That is the best choice.

The association systems, as I show in my little book, have two different roles, and these are very different. The first, and the most important one, is the self-associative role. These cells receive the same inputs from the rest of the cortical areas and make a huge excitatory network of themselves, which then becomes one that may be called a higher order associational circuit. The second one, which is equally important, is where these areas are connected to other cortical areas, and these are, again, the associational sites, so they are different things.'",

And that's an extremely, extremely interesting question, to know how the association areas evolved and the language areas evolved, and whether both processes and mechanisms are similar, or whether there are mechanisms that, that, that, a different level of organization.

I can give you several examples in the primary visual area which would also be a reasonable suggestion for the primary purpose of a cortical region because it's a primary, or as we call it a first order, cortical region. Now, it's just a very small strip of tissue, but if we go in and we dig deep enough and we study everything that it does, we find, in fact, several distinct things within the primary visual area, and each one of these things seems to have its own primary purpose. So, at the level of the single cell, it is a very different kind of object, like the hippocampus, which is a complex system with many components. There are lots of different structures. My answer would be that the highest order cortical areas also have a large number of components, and every structure is not equally useful for every function.'"

You'd get nothing from that single neuron, nothing from that single action potential. The other single neurons would go on. The second single neuron would go on. And the third single neuron would go again. And the result would be a burst of one hundred or so spikes in the population. That is, every single single neuron in the interconnected group of tens of thousands would discharge. And then it's the same single neuron again, and the bursting single neuron discharges again. This is called a high frequency oscillation. It is a very complex population event. In other words, very expensive. So what you want is something else that is cheaper, not so complex and much less expensive.'",

So we want to be able to use single neurons, but to do something useful with them. And it's very hard to do, because the single neuron can't do anything else but to fire. It can't do anything useful. And that's why in most of the models of single neurons, we assume that single neurons have only one function, which is to discharge. And that's how the single neuron in isolation operates and also the network with single neurons, the population as a whole, but the collective state, when the system is synchronized, is how fast it runs, not how useful it is to the organism, although that's important also. To be useful, to be useful to the organism, the single neuron has to discharge not only one or two times but again and again.'",

But this is also a fundamental difference between single neurons and all network events and the collective state of the population. And that is that with individual neurons, the activity is high all the time, or just once in a while. But population activity has a tendency to fall quite steadily at the rate of 0.5 or 1 Hz, which is very low and very long, and then it's the population as a collective that does a better job, that works harder. That's how we know it's the population, because it's not enough to have a single neuron. Once you start making sense of the activity of the population, it's an advantage to be able to do so.

Now, the slower your neurons, the slower the activity can spread.

What's the primary function of any area of the cortex, let's say, that is an input area. Now the way that I think about it is that your inputs are what you are interested in. The best example for me is the parietal cortex. The parietal cortex is an enormous area in the cortex. And it's really an input area and very, very important, very efficient in sensing inputs from the environment. But what about the outputs of the parietal cortex?'",

When the motor or sensory area, the primary motor cortex, is directly connected to a muscle, say a skeletal muscle, the muscle output, or if you will your own output. Then your mind is free for a full day. And now another one is a more recent observation that there are quite a large number of neurons in the parietal cortex that respond when you are in motion. The parietal areas respond when you are moving, and they respond to head position. And when you are looking or looking away, they are silent, or responding to head position only, but when you are moving. So they have some properties such as they can be active while you are not directly looking at them, therefore that's very interesting to study further.'"

Then, the second, for instance, example of an associational area is the middle layer of the prefrontal cortex where the two principal systems of the prefrontal cortex have their axons. And the thalamus and the basal forebrain, the primary associational areas, would have the same main function.'"

It's one of those categories that you can't help it, no matter how hard you try, and the same goes for many other things, but not for functions. We can't help it that we want to divide things into functions and not in a strict philosophical sense into what we can't help it. And no matter how much we want, it can't always be done. And the reason for that is that what we do is just to organize the brain in a functional way, just to organize the activity in a functional way.'"

But I would put a little addendum after that. Perhaps it would include something like \"recall them after they have been compressed, maybe compressed by consolidation or by some specific mechanism, in other words, compressed by the hippocampus. This part of it is important because you would have to deal with the fact that there is such a compression mechanism. This comes from the idea that the consolidation, in other words the preservation of what has been learned, but compressed.'",

I would try to define the function of the hippocampal system, and make your search inside it. In other words, if you were looking for the memory functions of the hippocampus, that is, it's fundamental property or its basic mechanism. The hippocampus could be the substrate in there. All you have to do is to make sure, of course, that it's a single, simple place cell. That would be a nice first step because it would allow you to test your question.

Now in another situation, I think you're trying to learn a new, new situation, and it requires the hippocampus to do things that are fundamentally different from the same situation, a familiar one.

And the main source of the lognormal distribution of the projections is, I want to say they're local-circuit excitatory connections. So they have strong local connections with long thin axons. That's a good thing. The local-circuit system has many, very interconnected small-world-like, low-diameter, long-range connections. It's a little more like a scale-free system than a typical random system. But what is not good about it is that it produces a skewed distribution of synaptic weights.

Therefore, our answer would be that a major function of the associations cortex is to provide a memory trace that allows for the combination of new and old memories, and therefore allows for memory of all events that are experienced in an animals lifetime. But then this memory, of course, also contains representations of learned associations between events and situations, that is, the context in which the events took place. So, the important point of view is that the two memories are basically the same, namely the new memory and the old memory, and the associations areas provide a link, a bridge between the two pieces.'",

This is different than remembering some other things for example or some other details.

And, then, in my experience, almost every time, one comes to a compromise of the two, which is the thing you have to work on, which has the most complexity, which has the hardest problems.

The two streams, in my view, are memory and action. They are pretty much separated, and you had the frontal eye field and the cingulate cortex areas as the front end of the associational cortical areas. And what we have found, as opposed to what I thought we should go to, is that the primary purpose for me is the action aspects of the association areas, that is, the higher order cortical areas.

In all of those areas, for example, not just in the prefrontal cortex, but in all of those areas where the action is taking place at this particular moment. I would put it more precise, though, and say that the primary purpose is that the higher order cortical system or at least one stream of the higher orders cortex is devoted to controlling action, which is a key aspect of the cognitive process. And perhaps in a similar way in other areas, the primary purpose is also to control action or to represent action.'",

It's not interested in memory, in fact.

It's a generalization of everything, but it's a useful generalization.

The name of that area is the striate cortex, which is a higher order area that does deal with the patterning of inputs, the segmentation of the visual inputs. Then there's the secondary cortex, which is an area with higher connectivity and higher density. Yet the way it processes information and deals with the consequences of the action is so very different that you hardly find two areas that have similar properties. So that is an interesting comparison, and that's what you're comparing.

So there was really no need for the mouse brain to get any more information than what it needed to detect motion. So that's why I think that it's very likely that the primary function of these areas is to provide the capacity for prediction from past experiences and not to store and store a lot more information that we don't need.

There's no question that the human cerebral cortex and the hominid ancestors cortical area has a fundamental specialization. I mean, no question about that, at all. My question is what is the fundamental specialization of the mouse cerebral cortex? So it's a two-stage process of cortical evolution. We can trace all the way back to the beginning of mammalian evolution and follow the stages of mammalian cortical evolution. So what does a rodent cortex have? It has associative cortical areas in its fronto-striatal-cerebellar axis and medial-lateral axis. It doesn't have association areas in other directions. It gets more associational as it becomes larger, but it doesn't have associational areas in other directions, so that's fundamental to its brain organization.

So, my question is, why is it such a fundamental difference? When you look at it from another point of view, why is it? Is it because the primary sensory input has such a large-ish territory? Is it because we have such large eyes? Is it because there are such large brains? Is it because, in other words, it has such a massive associational territory?

There are fundamental size differences, and the other thing is that is, that, you know, we have to make a different kind of computation in the brains of other animals than in our brains, and that is, that there are fundamental differences in the connectivity.

Now it's the job of those further associational areas, first, to see what's there, and second, they have to learn to recognize it as being something that could be, in principle, organized in a sequence of similar patterns on the basis of past experience.

To the,  to the hippocampus, hippocampus represents inputs, but, and it's a, a,  a representation, but a representation in a very specific way.

Lateral is a bit more like yours and lateral is a bit denser, and lateral has a lot to do with movement, whereas dorsalis is more like dorsal, which has more to do with vision. That makes lateral a little bit more compact, although lateral is more like yours and much denser. What you have is a lot of different areas, and the big one is the primary visual cortex. Its purpose or the primary purpose of course is obviously vision and color perception, and lateral has more to do more with movements. And the motor areas are lateral, and lateral is a little bit similar to yours. But lateral is also similar to midtemporal frontal area of course, which is a little bit more than two mm two. But that's lateral, and lateral in that area is pretty much identical to what in the primary visual cortex is primary visual cortex.'",

But I am not sure really why lateral is so important for movement, because lateral has a lot of connections to lateral intraparicular. And lateral actually looks a bit more like dorsal in the lateral intraparicular, and lateral intraparicular in fact has a little bit less to do with movement than lateral. But there are many, many, many, perhaps twenty lateral intraparicular areas, which in the mouse might look a little bit more like dorsal than lateral, although these are often very fine cortical areas.

And people thought that rhythm was something that happened in time, and that the rhythm of the heart was something that didn't always happen. But in fact, the heart was a beating oscillator long before the brain, and then when it started to think, it started to generate a rhythm. So there is a relationship between the rhythms and the behaviors that are, those are very similar.

And those thalamic terminals that you have that send to the associational areas are pretty much limited to one region, which is the cingolopyramidal or posterior parietal area, and they form one single area. And that single area is very well defined by the size of the cortical columns and the number of layers, the number of cells and the anatomical distribution of neurons.

Anyway, they did not answer the precise questions, but if you could think about this as a, in principle, any type of perceptual process. What is the critical part? Where would you choose to make a compromise? I suggest that, as in every system, there is a small part, which really matters, and that is the, as you said, the big compromise.

But you have, on the other hand, a large brain. Why do you need so many structures? Why do you need that many?

And that's what the brain is doing. So in principle the hippocampus could be a graph, where neurons would be connected to the entorhinal cortex and to the neocortex and other regions, and that could support the ability to form a \"memory graph\", which would allow you to form a graph of memories. Or in the case of a memory it would be a graph of memories, which could be a quite useful thing because it would allow you to remember a new memory, or forget an old memory.

There are some things you always want to take out and you think that's the essence, and there are other things you don't. Even if many people did, you never do have to say what is this? This is it.

Even if one neuron in the complex network has no input, what if you have a complex network that never breaks it apart? What happens, what will happen to the thing they built up forever? There are only two possibilities: it works, or it breaks down. If it works, it's the best, and if it works well it lasts forever with no problem.

The pyramidal cells are the only layer 4 stellate cells we have in the brain, which have a big basket shaped or stellate appearance and can extend all around those other pyramidal cells. Those are the only stellate cells that we have. Most pyramidal cells in the hippocampus are thin and tapered to a point. So why are we looking at the thinnest cells, then?

And the result of all those work was an article in Nature that now you can look at the human brain. Which is not easy. You can look at its connectivity, but you can look at its computation in a way that's like maybe we can start thinking about how to look at it better and so on.

And maybe this is why it's so hard to solve these problems, because there's a lot of different patterns, and it doesn't make any sense to call them information transfer patterns. Or information transfer, because information transfer is in some sense a fundamental operation. For example, when you get your eyes fixed, there's no transfer of information because information doesn't live in the transfer, but perhaps the activity of neurons in your visual pathways predicts whether the animal's in the left or in the right.'",

So it's a bit like that in the hippocampus, where many of the neuronal firing sequences are random from the point, you know, there are only 5 or 6 neurons that, that can predict a particular position in the environment, but a very large reservoir of neurons can generate a whole lot of sequences that are more or less random.

In other words, a fixed sequence is encoded in a single place field and this place field is, but a single unit is much more complex than a single place field. It generates many place fields, and the activity of many more place fields can generate tens of thousands of different sequences in a given small volume.

The first thing the eye encounters in the world are two streams of light which come together outside the brain. As you know all elementary pupils are myelinated and I said, 'I must have a white paper somewhere. Then I asked my students: can you describe these two elements and tell me what it is or look and tell me what they are?' And they all agreed there was something special about them, and they had never seen the elements before and had never heard of them. Their first idea was to call them black and white, but they're not black or white. They have a particular color, so they called them color after those.'"

For example, that's why in a particular experiment, you find that the responses to an auditory signal are different from those to a visual signal, and the reason being that the motor responses are different. And as a consequence the whole representation changes. That is to say, the representation is, or there are areas that are activated very slightly in response to sounds or visual stimuli, but only slightly. So you get only very, very little change in the representation, even though there may be a change in the firing rate and number of neurons that become active. And that's why we have to be careful because that's not really an answer to the question that you're asking, but as one of many answers that meet the requirement which is a reliable response.'"

So I guess it's the best way that is possible. This is something a little bit different than the way that we've looked at it in our lab for decades. But what is to me maybe more interesting is, as you know, Dr. Alfred, or we know, is that the higher order association areas in the cerebral cortex function as though they were little 'cortical hubs' because they are very large in terms of their axonal tree, a bit like the small cortical hub areas of the visual areas.'",

In many, many ways more extensive and so on, in many, many ways. And so it's almost as if they were a little bit special because they can serve as a kind of sort of special coordinator - so, to answer your question right now I just don't know what makes them a hub, but the most important is the fact that they are the most large scale, so to answer that, no, the most important is to say that they are special because they are the most special in terms of the anatomical connectivity, as far as I know, or as far as I can say, because we've examined enough areas in the mouse.

Even if you say hippocampus or prefrontal cortex, when we draw, when we draw it, the drawing is so different that it's hard to even tell that these are the same region. So in that case I'd say, for example, how about the most special region is the hippocampus because the most striking difference is the hippocampal region.

Actually, they are important structures because they are part and parcel of the same cortex, is what I would like to say. I think it is important, for the sake of the human brain, to ask what are the functions of the association areas. We know that there are a thousand times more associational areas in the mouse brain than there are in the rat brain, and the mouse cortex is smaller than a rat cortical slab. It is a small cortex.

What he did was very clever. What he did is to make a large number of coronal sections of the association areas from every species and then from each section the architecturally reconstructions could be made. In other words the spatial organization of the associational networks in those sections is what allowed to make very accurate reconstructions of cortical architecture and to calculate the cortical surface and the volume or cubic volume in terms of their own cortical volume.'",

This was a very important finding, that the way how areas are connected and with each other is different in all species.

One way of getting there is that you take this long trip from the hippocampus in the long axis of the cortex in the dorsal direction. Then you finally use this shortcut that takes one quarter rather than one half of the distance from the hippocampus to get to the other end of the septum.

It can do that, and it's related to something else that's called grid cells. Now, what is grid cells, you know, for instance?'",

So I suggest that they're just part of the large association areas which are pretty much hard wired. The higher order cortex has to be wired differently. So what seems to be the primary role of this higher order cortex is to make decisions. That is, as I already mentioned, there's a large parietal area, and there's a frontal area where you can decide, for instance, whether to go one way or another, but there are two parts of areas there, one of them is called \"motor cortex\" where the cortex is pretty much hard wired, and it's basically a small, closed-loop area.

Dr. Bert: So you know, it's very difficult to separate out an intrinsic function from an epiphenomenal function. And I think that's true for all brain areas. You're never going to know what you're looking for, or what is it, at the level of the level of one single neuron or a single synapse because you can't see through the cell body or see the end of the axon, for example.

So, I'm perfectly fine with that if you point to any structure that has a, and I can put my fingers on it as the epiphenomenon, and say \"Oh, they made a paper that describes how, for example, gamma oscillations in this structure, which is not a primary function but is an epiphenomeneon function.\" 'Dr.'",

To be able, therefore, to find its way back, the brain has to use the map to combine the things that were already stored in the long-term memories with the new experience. And the reason why it can find its way back is because the hippocampus has the necessary information to do that, and it has the appropriate long-term memory to extract that information.'",

And it was pretty much in line with our thinking that the hippocampal network can serve as a pattern classifier mechanism - to deal with multiple dimensions of information at the same time and select aspects that correlate with the thing which has features that are most relevant to the animal's current goal.

The medial, lateral edge forms an 'L' shape, and there's a medial lateral edge. In order to simplify things, a two-dimensional map is transformed into what's called 'boundary vector field'. That is, the cells become border cells instead of place cells'.

At another spot, in another brain area, they asked him to give them something.

And he decided to call the brain areas associated with the, \"Achilles tendon,\" and \"tongue,\" respectively. He called the new brain areas by the names of the things that made sense to him at the time.

In other words, it's a substrate that's used, not necessarily for what you're doing, but to support more complicated functions. So at least that's one possibility. As far as I'm concerned, I never ever thought that these areas are connected the way many people seem to think that they're connected and have been connected for years.

There are some differences, but what doesn't change is that a brain receives information and then it has to interpret that information and send the output. It doesn't matter whether the sending is a large or small network at all. And the information then goes and it does its job. And now it sends the information to other brain regions. What's different is the human brain is a hierarchical system, whereas it's a feedforward system in other animals.

Now if we had a small mouse brain and big brains, like there must be a big advantage to having a large brain. And you already mentioned as well the advantages of a hierarchical system. You know, the brains ability to take in information from multiple sources and separate them and merge them and divide them and combine them and separate the two parts separately.

But it is an important question because, well, this is not so far from your primary work, and you spent about a decade on the study of how the brain is organized by its many rhythms, and especially of how the brain can be reconfigured or deformed by sensory inputs and affect its own operations in the same way that you might ask whether a particular brain or a particular neuron in the brain does something or does something or represents something or does something.

From there it enters the hippocampus, and that's where the memory content is encoded. And by encoding it, I mean that the hippocampus transforms that information into a system of place cells - which are a sort of a multiple-dimensional, high-resolution representation of the sequence and the context of an experience. And these place cells are distributed in space, with the same probability of occurrence in any location. Now, to make a memory, it seems that you would just make a copy of those patterns.'",

And there it's been an impasse for a long, long time. So my opinion would be that it's the same. It's always about what you want to know.'"

If you said that you had a simple brain on your wrist, that would be more or less like an alarm clock. Then you could wake up, eat a breakfast, get dressed up, and go to work. In contrast to that, with a complicated system, you would have different associations for different circumstances, and you would think differently about similar situations.

So like in computer science, there is a syntax, a program or a rule by which every possible string of messages would be translated, and the more sophisticated our technology becomes the less we need to refer to things as strings of representations. And the more one is able to go beyond this representation, and translate all the possible variations in the representation to a rule. And of course it has to come to the right hand without destroying the information, because it's a sequence, and it's a succession, and it's not just the combination of strings of dots and dashes, it's a sequence.

Let me give you a simple analogy to illustrate my answer. Your brain is a telephone system, where messages are conveyed by cables to connected partners. In our local telephone system, for the sake of convenience, the system is organized to allow conversations between people in different homes. In other words, the telephone system is designed to let any one of us, anywhere, communicate with any other, using a single phone. In the brain, the so-called 'cognitive circuit' that allows us to talk to each other is a single cable ending at a single neuron connected at one end to a cable, which carries information from other parts of the brain. By this definition, the function of the associational areas in the mouse brain is basically to create shortcuts or add-ons to help other circuits.'",

The associational areas in your system - where we're discussing now - is different from the associational areas where I'm talking about in the hippocampus. You know, in the hippocampus, the associational areas are a very large place that is much, much larger, so that these associational areas have a similar spatial organization to that of the hippocampus.

What the cortex has is this, and what the hippocampus has, or at least what hippocampus has, is this: that in this layer you can imagine that there are large numbers of neurons that have multiple connections, and that's called 'association cortex' and that are distributed in a highly regular manner. These neurons can receive inputs in a highly regular fashion. There are only a handful of principal neurons in the brain. In fact, the principal cells are very rare. Maybe 1 in 100000, perhaps as many as 1 in 400,000.

You know, when it's a particular question about the mouse you can say about an invertebrate with maybe 10,000 neurons that's been around for a long time, many hundreds of thousands of years, and I can give you an answer that would look right if you ask that question in a different context.'",

The information that is communicated across these highly interconnected associational areas is organized differently. And it's not just by the firing rates, because the neurons in this higher cortical regions have many more connections than their peers in the primary sensory cortices. They have many more connections, so the firing rate differences are quite small. What they have is this associational, higher-order cortical region that can control the rate of activity in each given location. And what the other areas can do is only to control the direction of activity. And this is also true in the rat and the cat, among others. It's a really cool finding, and it's quite new.'",

Let's just take a random example, the hippocampus, which is our kind of big memory cortex, for example. When we come into a room for the first time, our response is very similar; we don't know which direction to move to get to a target. That is, there is no distinct area at all. It's just how we respond, so then we are already moving in the right direction, we just have to respond once to a room. When we have many repetitions, we get habituated to the response. Then, when we are in a different room, we remember it, and there is no need to move in the other direction. The point is that the brain doesn't have distinct areas; it's simply a question of a brain state. Now, of course, there is no need in the brain state for neurons to be dedicated to particular aspects of the environment.'",

To put it in a broader terms, they are areas that help in constructing a concept. So for example, in the case of the hippocampus, they are areas of the hippocampus that are not dedicated to a particular aspect of processing in the outside world but they can be called the hippocampal association cortex. Of course, they can also be called part of the hippocampus, but their main function is to construct a concept. For example, they can be, just like in the case of a word for an object, such as a car for me, a person or, in different phases of life, a different aspect of yourself.

And I know from first hand experience this is what you actually did, you actually went into the association areas of the brains of the cats, and mice and rats and investigated this. And in mice and rats you were particularly interested about the hippocampal system, and in particular the dentate gyrus. And you found out that the dentate gurus are actually organized in a similar manner to a symphony orchestra, or if you like a Beethoven symphony.

He said that he thought the primary purpose of associational areas in the primate brain and especially in the hippo-pocampus, was to provide a substrate for memory.

First of all, I think it would be nice if the hippocampus had an associative area, which would enable it to remember which route you took to get to and from a place. Obviously, it's not an easy memory to track. It's a long sequence of events, and it's very difficult. But with the hippocampus being so flexible, it would be really great if the long sequences could have some kind of an area that would associate them. Second, I agree with you that the hippocampus is amazing at creating a representation of the environment, in which case I don't think it would be so very different from the outside world. And if that kind of representation is a two-dimensional representation that is flexible and flexible and can be conformed to many different things, then that's perfectly consistent with the associative area.'",

So we create a \"representation\" of that square that is some kind of thing, some sort of representation. And if, by chance, that thing does happen to be the same color. Then that thing becomes a representation. So we go on from any thing to a representation of the thing. Now that's what I'd like to develop in my associative area. Because what makes me most confident about the hippocampus is the fact that it's so pliable. And it can be flexibly conformed or adapted either to memories or to representations. And that is an associative-adaptable representation of the environment that doesn't need to be calibrated from the outside world for each event that's going on.'",

And the idea is that you already have one of those, so you give yourself a good representation in that, you have a good spatial representation, so you can use that as a representation of the world, or the environment. But, what would be really good is if you could have that representation as a two-dimensional matrix, or matrix, that could then be conformed to the environment. Conformed means the hippocampus is not only flexible but can be compressed or stretched to represent the environment. So there would be a sort of a higher order-cortex, associated with the hippocampus. Then, that higher order-cortical area would be the flexible, associative area that would allow the representation to conformed, or be compressed in a two-dimensional way to represent the environment, or the context for the hippocampus, which then serves as a representation of either what's outside, or what's inside the environment.'"

But, but that's true even if we say these are associations areas, that they're not glue or glue-like, no matter what they have in common. They're actually just a special kind of computation. For example, in my very simplest computer. I just have a couple of different...what is called a combinatorial logic. I have three inputs.

And that is, so if I want to make a bridge, a computation in itself, in the simplest case. You have to, first give me a wire with one end into what is called an input element, and the second end, which is called an output element, at the other pole. And then you also have a wire with a third end, which will connect that output to its own output. So all you have to have is three...two of them are already established, and then you can connect them like in a bridge.'"

And then what you can call a cell assembly that is formed by the firing of three or four neurons is called a module, like an item, in other words. And there's probably more than a hundred of different place modules just within these two regions, and that makes the hippocampal-entorhinal system almost a mini language.'",

The first thing in the temporal lobe is the olfactory, which is responsible for detecting very particular odorants, which a cat has to detect to survive. Because the same odorants in the same concentrations have different flavors for a cat. And that's why your olfactory bulb has so many different layers, right, that it can be sensitive to more particular odorants than your nose is, so when you detect your own fur smells, you don't smell like cat, but when you sniff someone else's hair, you smell...just like that.'",

This can be done for many, maybe many tens, sometimes hundreds of independent variables, when you have a lot of data. And when you have several brains that are similar in anatomical connectivity, similar in many other things, and are being influenced by different types of inputs from within and from the environment, I see no reason why you can't use that data to discover mechanisms -'a syntax - that will explain the function of the network activity that gives rise to that output'in a statistical sense.  and use those mechanisms to examine how this is connected to other things.'"

This seemed to be a very complicated task as we did not yet know precisely how spatial information is organized in the hippocampus. So I really thought that the best way to understand this is to make a simple circuit, containing only two or three, maybe four, small interconnected groups of neurons, in which the sequence compression, the compression of order can be demonstrated quite simply. And the first one was the dentate gyrus, and the most successful circuit in this respect was perhaps the small circuit made up of the mossy cells of the hilus that form the most direct path from the entorhinal layer 2 neurons to the granule cells of the dentate gyle.'",

It's kind of an old-fashioned, classical point of view, perhaps, but the fundamental, it's really fundamental, is that they're really important for the communication among the various subcortical nuclei. So what I would like to see is that every subcortical nucleus is a bit on its own with a very distinct set of inputs with maybe a slightly different wiring, but then they send out different projections to other subcortical centers. And so those very different subcortical subnuclei are linked together in the same way.

And then we found these big association areas, where no differences were observed between the neocortical and hippocampus systems. And the term association cortical areas simply referred to that property, but we can also call them higher order cortical areas and many other names.

The people who were first to do the Brodmann system discovered that the major part of this associational cortex had the same cytoarchitectonic organization in the mouse as in humans, and so they suggested that perhaps it has the same brain functions. Of course, the most common answer is, of course it does, but then they were also saying the simplest answer, which is, sure, it's really good for keeping memories but of course it also has to do things and so on.'",

If associating areas are simply critical only for retrieving memories then why do we have them? Why would we spend much more nervous system resources on this question? The reason is that the memories are not stored in some parts of the brain but rather in the entire brain. Therefore, the most efficient way to store memories is to have a large memory system with no clear boundaries, not just a large associating area. That way, when we want to retrieve memories, or to store memories, we have to make sure that the entire brain is involved, which is what we call 'one-for-all-and-everywhere'.'",

They also claim that the association areas have very specific structures that serve to bind the separate streams of information, which they call segregated streams. And the main stream of information, through which a huge amount of information arrives, is the so-called feed-forward stream, which comes from the lateral geniculate body to the primary visual cortex, where it has already been segmented and decomposed by the thalamus and the primary visual cortex itself. And then the information comes back in a few milliseconds in the form of a spike from the primary visual cortex to the post-primary cortex and it becomes useful.'",

Let's say that some stream of information comes from the lateral olfactory tract to a higher order area, which in our case would be the prefrontal cortex. Then the information gets decomposed to subsegments by various segments and the segments get bound in the form of neuronal assemblies. So now we have several subsegments that can be bound together in the form of assemblies to bring them to a few high order areas, which in our brains would, for example, be responsible for planning.'",

It happens rather, no, it happens for a while, but then it sorta, kind of disappears over time.

I'd like to build up a map of the network, and see this from the perspective of the connectivity between layer five pyramidal neurons, rather than from the perspective of a very large amount of interneuronal units. In other words, I think the primary problem in the brain is how this information is organized. We think they're organized by oscillations.

And that is what my model has to do with. And then the oscillation is the result of the local interactions among those neurons, which are organized through the local inhibitory connections, and a self-sustained oscillator emerges in the local circuit.

So we had to make a lot of assumptions, in particular about the kind of operations that we are using in the medial prefrontal areas, about how they function. What we have found is that the medial prefrontal cortex has a lot of the properties that you mentioned.'",

So this part of cortex is very different. It has a big part which is a very important part of the brain for memory, which does almost what we think of as memory, although, not fully.'",

I'm asking that because if the hippocampus is doing a very difficult job, the most dangerous job of memory, planning, imagination, and memory in fact, and imagination, then the ventral prefrontal cortex, which is quite distinct from the hippocampus, must be doing some things other than memory and planning and imagining at this stage of cognitive evolution. They must have some different operations that cannot be done by a simple version of a recurrent system in which connections between neurons are formed by a single synapse. This is very unlikely to happen because what's the advantage of this mechanism? What benefit you can get from it, so far as you know, from the fact that the connections are formed by a few synapses? So you can understand the memory of, let's say, 20 people, say, but in a few synapses.'"

This is a mathematical tool, a mathematical operation to extract the features that distinguish one entity from something else, such as a face from a photograph.

Now, you can ask it how many different faces it can recognize in all the 20,000 species, and it gives you a very good chance that you would be able to come up with a list that is very different from the list you got from asking it about humans.

In the brain of the mouse, for example, you can have different classes of neurons. For example, one class may not respond, do you know, to visual stimuli, and one class, maybe, responds only to visual stimuli in motion. So you can make a very elaborate map here with a total of around 600 different things in a row, or just a dozen, and then put a single neuron out there to help you remember one item. But a single neuron from the beginning doesn't respond to any visual item or anything else. In other words, it's no good at all.

The information that your question is asking, is whether those areas are primarily input driven or output driven. So what I'd like to say as a response to that is not just some answer in general, but I'm going to answer it in the details. And in the context of the mouse cortex, so the primary source of information is what we called the 'action system'. What are the major output structures.

In order of the number... in order of the size, we have the cerebrum, the basal ganglia, the limbic system, the hippocampus, and the ventral hippocampus or the subicular complex.

And I think that they're very important for multiple reasons. First, I think that the cortex is not a linear line. It's a tree-shaped system. In this tree-shaped system, a certain number of local axons, called axons of association areas, that connect all the regions. These branches are very important. Very thin branches, but it can send out very long branches, but here we have something like this now. The white lines are call white matter. It's made up of these long cortical columns that contain mainly axons. And they run perpendicular to the long axis of the cortex, at a relatively similar depth from the surface. So it's like a two-dimensional sheet. And, you know, you can draw it like this, we would say.'"

Then the information can be moved around, it can be organized in high-level groups. And this is what enables it to work as a memory system or even, perhaps, a decision-making system.'"

What's surprising is exactly the opposite thing, so I would assume that the same brain circuit is supporting basically the same functions in the mouse as in the human brain, but the human system is far more developed and far more advanced.

It serves as a kind of a store at one's disposal in the brain for large chunks of associations and fragments of memories. Now, the interesting thing is that from that perspective, if you try to remember a series of items, it's very natural if you start out with your mind's eye and the mind's eye is filled with something similar to the sequence of items. It's just a matter of making one more association. And that's the way in which it works I think, and that's what it does.

Can't they do things, as it was sort of implied in my book, 'The Inferior') that in other mammals, it's often called the visual field, because mammals are pretty visual, and mammals have vision in most parts of the visual field and not in others, and yet in the very special association areas, they do almost all kinds of visual functions.

But if you look at the picture from the angle that the hippocampal pyramidal cells tend to have a narrow place field or place fields, which are very well-spaced, and at the same time are aligned, all the fields line up in the septal to the temporal direction, you can clearly see that there is a large overlap of place fields that are very similar in terms of spatial alignment, spacing, and directionality of the place fields.

And it gives the same result. And I think that's already the beginning of an answer because, I mean, you see exactly how your neurons respond, and you can conclude that you need a single main big area for your whole representation of the input pattern, if it comes from the eye. And that's why a simple stimulus can evoke such a very specific response in such a large neuron group which in a way might identify the features of such stimuli by a particular arrangement of the visual features, or as you know, the configuration of the visual world.'"

This is so important because of the many redundancies found in the input output relationship. If the brain receives the same information during sleep or while the body is in the same position after a long nap, you can only say that information is redundant if it somehow helps you to discriminate between sleep and wakeup, but that is not the case, which I assume is the reason that you put the brain on high alert in the first place.'"

And what they did was to take the anatomical connectivity of the primate cortical areas, which is very similar to the cortex of a mouse as well.

There are neurons that project to the higher parts of the associational cortex and the anterior pole of the brain. There are other neurons that project to one region out of the cortex.

As you know, the question of how the whole is more important than the parts is really quite deep in neuroscience. There are a couple of principles that are fundamental in nature, which are scale and homeostasis, and everything else. Scale is about the relationship among parts.
