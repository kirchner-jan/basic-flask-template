  "name": "The following is a transcript of a conversation between the two famous neuroscientists Dr. Buzsaki and Dr. Marder. Dr. Buzsaki's primary interests is 'neural syntax', i.e., how segmentation of neural information is organized by the numerous brain rhythms to support cognitive functions. Dr. Marder studies the dynamics of small neuronal networks, and her work was instrumental in demonstrating that neuronal circuits are not 'hard-wired' but can be reconfigured by neuromodulatory neurons and substances to produce a variety of outputs. The two are having a public academic panel discussion about the function of the higher-order-cortex.\n-BEGIN TRANSCRIPT-\n",

One of the first animals to be studied extensively was the stomatopod, the crustacean. The crustaceans had very complex nervous systems with a vast number of neurons, right? Then we learned how to identify a brain neuron based on its connectivity, connectivity, right, and then to look at these neurons, then to look for the relationship between these neurons. So we've always been focused on the biological relationship between neurons.'",

So a lot of the ideas that come out in the theory community, I have often been very much intrigued by: it's like when they talk about how the central pattern generator has been described as'slow' and'sustained' or 'cancellation.' So it has some kind of properties that are very similar to a voltage-gated I A, which is one of the fast, voltage-gated channels, and its membrane capacitance increases over hours, days and weeks.  We're told that that is important.'",

All of a sudden, all kinds of things turn up, because dopamine affects a great many other things you would not expect.

And so in fact, there are 20 hubs, but the vast majority in the cortex is a very strongly connected group, so that the hub, I suppose, is the hippocampus. There's no hub called for the thalamus, or maybe the mid-brain. And it's a long list of the hubs that you have. For me, the question was \"are we good enough that we can come up with the brain's hub-like-hippocampal networks of the brain? Or does it need specialized circuits that have to be built?'",

So mammals are very closely related, we are evolutionarily distant from mice, mice evolved from different kinds of animals. And so it comes into the brain by different pathways, of course, but it finds its way to consciousness. It finds its way to action. So by that definition it is necessary to have all the different kinds of wiring. But in a way, it becomes more important if you have a theory of how a brain works.

For me I think it's probably going to be the crab. There's a number of animals that are good. But crabs are really good in a very specific set of situations. Because, for one, crabs are warm-blooded animals. They live in the ocean, they feed up there so they're easy to do experiments with. And they really have been developed for years and years by people like the Haverfield Lab and so on. And there's also been a whole set of tools developed for doing electrophysiological experiments on crabs, and again, they're the sort of simple small nervous systems to go in with, just with simple preparations. So that I think that these are all things that are good for what you're doing.'",

That's why I'm going to pick this simple neuron.  And perhaps you can pick one of your model neurons to do the same thing. So that's something that we can get a feel for. So the question is, what are the mechanisms? If I pick a very general neuron, which we have already built and which we have data on, then how do you tell me why, how do you decide which neuron to study? It seems obvious to me, but maybe to others it will not be so obvious. So there are also more subtle elements like the size of the neuron. It can have lots of synapses.'",

For example, the mouse and rat are extremely similar, and so are relatively easy to manipulate and to do very large numbers of experiments with.

The only advantage of the crab system for us is that all the connections between the muscles, the neurons, and the peripheral nerves are well defined already. And as far as the motor patterns, we know that they are stereotyped, because they are produced in a repeated rhythm within any single animal. So for the most part we can work on a model that uses that same network of neurons, that has the same membrane currents, that produces motor patterns as the brain would. So this allows us to work in more general settings, to work in situations with less experimental control and to work under more interesting conditions.

A recent paper that I co-authored with some colleagues identified the specific synaptic changes resulting from continuous repeated activity in the cortical network. In that case, the effects of repeated activation of the pyloric pacemaker network by the anterior ventricular nerve ( a vn ) of the pacemaker kernel of the pylorus was found to be quite complex and surprising, because the network showed both synaptic changes (as expected for a dynamic network) and changes in response to other modulatory inputs.'",

So these particular neurons, we would go in and take these drugs. The drug would change the activity of these neurons, and I would say that probably every three months we would go over there and say we'd find these neurons were bursting with tonic spiking and, I don't know, and it was very difficult to detect the activity of these brain networks.

Because the neurons know how the circuits evolve and the properties of the circuits change... We have to think about how to do our experiments in such a way that we can test this: is a circuit stable. Is the function of the neurons changing over time? Does the function of the network change if it's not stable? Then we have to ask how robustness can occur over evolutionary time scales. One of the most fascinating aspects of this is that when you see neurons that look identical, they still end up being completely different. And that's where you see the complexity is.'",

So, they seem to be a lot more like human neurons than many of these other systems, more like a collection of human cells kind of glued together, with a variety of circuits and behaviors that have evolved individually, although they have many underlying principles that are conserved, the circuits that control rhythmic movements that control food intake, eating behavior, etc.'",

Of course, our understanding about the nervous system has increased substantially with more sophisticated preparations in which many, many, many neurons are monitored. So I think models of whole animals have been important. The advantage of mice is that as model systems have been developed for the use of genetics and for developing models for brain imaging, we now have models that can be used to monitor brain activity. So it'll be important for us over time to refine and develop a whole variety of model systems that are very flexible and will serve different experimental purposes, but will also allow us to do experiments that involve measurements outside of the brain.'",

In fact, I had many colleagues who said that they could never understand the brains of other people because they could not appreciate how important it was to know the properties of individual cells that made them unique. What are you interested in? I understand that some of our best papers are studies that tell us about the properties of individual cell types that give rise to specific functions. So the individual cells themselves have quite strong constraints that arise from their intrinsic properties, their interactions with the outside world, and the properties of the circuit that is made up by the individual groups of cells. But I think knowing the properties of individual neuron types is really important for understanding the brain because ultimately we're going to study the properties of neurons that we don't have.'",

One of the things that some of the more extreme colleagues in neuroscience told me that we could never understand the brain. For example, we could find no correlation between the properties of a cell and its fate as a neuron type. That seems obvious now. But it was obvious that a cell that has certain properties cannot be a neuron as an individual cell and it can only be a neuron in the brain. The other thing that we're interested in are questions that, like other biological systems, like plants, for example. I mean, how plants manage to grow food for people, if you think about that.

So in the peripheral nervous system, there are multiple neurons.

And this segregation is called by many investigators the critical part of the development of neuronal networks to allow complex operations that are needed for cognition and cognition is the complex operations of the brain. And it should be, uh, I put it in a little bit, uh, more specific, and that's the definition of the brain. So, so that the brain is a circuit that produces behavior for a particular purpose.

So that had us thinking we may not have a single compartment, but maybe we might have many compartments by varying the osmolarity in the different compartments. So that led us to do a study of two different osmotic conditions. We had made solutions with varying sodium conductances, and we tried to take two neurons with conductances that had comparable values of Na + s, and then we would do osmotic manipulations and then compare the two. And so initially we had four groups of eight different kinds of neurons, and we did all the different kinds of osmotic manipula-tions.'",

Now this is a very important thing because timing is how that information is organized.

So there are many unknowns, but one very interesting aspect in the human brain, for example, is what's known as the corpus callosum is the major connecting pathway between the left and right nerves, but the neurons that are the connecting neurons, the projection neurons are the same! So, different neurons, different cell types contribute to connecting one nerve to another nerve \u2013 different neuronal types contribute to connecting muscle fibers, and different cell types contribute connecting muscles to the same nerves, and so the only difference between the left and the right neuron, is their cell type. So even though you have this connecting path, there are still differences in terms of the properties that each neuron may take that cause asymmetry or even lack of coherence between their networks. So, yes, it's interesting - it's one of the areas of interest.  You know, the number of neurons \u2013 it seems like most neurons are innervated by many, many other cells.'",

In the  S/N-m  neuron, which generates and releases a variety of neurotransmitters, one of them is somatostatin, and in addition to releasing it, this neuron also releases a ton of all of the other neurotransmitters.

That is, once it has received the synaptic information from other neurons, it is actually going to release a molecule that is going to block the neurotransmission at the synaptic terminal when its GABAergic activity has a high-enough level. And in the case of SST neuro-transmitters, the timing of release at the synaptic input would be strictly under the control of a molecular clock: a circadian clock, which is in synchrony with the other functions in the brain. This is a very exciting aspect of this mechanism because it has all the necessary properties to serve a particular function, a special function. It works well in a well-dissolved manner. It is very responsive, and it is highly effective.'",

And I think that's something that we all agree on because we think that you know it's not necessary for brains to have every input they might require but, there are some very important functions that they require that just can't be done when you are not providing certain inputs. You know, the neurons might be silent because their neurotransmitters aren't doing their usual functions, or they might be suppressed because other neurons in some sort of network might be active. So you got neurons that might not be present or even working when you need them but we really should not allow neurons to have to be constantly regulated by a lot of other neurons or neurons in our brain.

The mouse and the other mammals, which would be the closest to other animals, the neurons that are associated with the cortex in mice are mostly sensory-related neurons, and that means that your cortex in the mouse is involved in sensing temperature but also in sensing food. We know that the other mammals for example have cortices that sense food but have not that temperature sensitivity. But this part of the brain, which is temperature sensitive in the mouse, is involved in all sorts of different functions. So, I really don't know how useful this brain was for the mouse to have this temperature sensitive part of its brain.

And now there is another way of doing it, which is using this cortex to calculate how many other neurons have been active in this temperature change. This is called the integration problem.

Then you connect those neurons to neurons that are firing, that are part of the cortex, and you connect them to a network of neurons, and you start calculating things.

And the hippocampus sends out an activity packets in response to that activity packet during sharp wave ripples. It's the hippocampus-initiated process that allows for the retrieval of memory traces and the replay of such memories during sleep, during the consolidation of our memories. I think in a certain sense, this is the fundamental process by which information processing in the brain transpires. And the most fundamental operation of the hippocampus is oscillations.

So, this is different from a study that was done about  Drosophila, because there are different subtypes of neurons. That is, in the case of mice, there are several varieties of pylorus neurons, so we do know that a few years ago, when we made mice that were different in many ways, we found out that some of them had no discernable phenotype, and were sort of normal, but some had a phenotype of either small or large sizes of their brain lobes.

So for instance, we used to think this was all in synaptic connections between the neurons, and we used to think that the synaptic connections between the neuron were graded by the strength, just like in the synaptic connections in the spinal cord, or elsewhere, and we used this to study neural variability. So we used this to figure out how robust our nervous systems could be, how variable our nervous systems might be, and so on.'",

They can go completely crazy without regulation, but the higher order cortical neurons control the brain circuits in the same way. And it is interesting that despite the fact that there are many other systems, if you really think about it, there is only one solution and one that is not totally crazy, and it is regulation of excitability that is being maintained that is critical for controlling function.

I do' not want to answer that is not a well-thought-out question, but it is a question I have started in my mind since the beginning. And it really has been bothering me.

And so that they maintain their ability to use very different types of ion channels and to respond to synaptic potentials at different rates during times of need, and during times that are more flexible, because it is easy to disrupt neural activity when the brain is using a particular type of activity.  So, I think that is definitely important, and I don't think that's been addressed enough in the discussion of why the cortex has this type of cell type. I think that a big thing that I've been working on recently that is very interesting: We think about regulatory sequences, and regulatory sequences are not necessarily constrained in the way that it has traditionally been thought they would be.

I mean, the reason that you want to create a neuron during development that is capable of being regulated properly during development is very different, but again it's a kind of constraint you can use. So, that was a big area I started to look into was regulatory sequences, this idea that if you have a neuron in your brain that is not regulated properly, it will not behave properly.

So, the other big difference is that neurons do not have multiple action potentials, they have a single action potential.

It has only one action potential  AP  and the other two APs are suppressed, and because these neurons always produce an AP, they are not suppressed. And there are many, many types of cell where when the neurons are not active, the APs are suppressed. But these neurons have a unique feature because when they get excited, they will excite the other neurons in the network, or excite themselves \u2013 so when they fire, they fire not because of their intrinsic excitability. So, they can fire because of the other neurons firing. So they are self-activated, it was originally called self-activation from the paper published about these cells because they can activate themselves when other cells are firing. So, they also can generate their own action potentials and also excite other network neurons.'",

So not being passive detectors of information but to generate feedback and control the activity of the circuit. I think that would also apply to larger networks. So your system might need to have some control properties for tuning the network. You know what I think it could also be. The other thing that occurs to me would be when you make a model of neural circuits that you make a model that is going to help you understand how it works.

So the voltage signal that they are putting out is probably a tonic firing that is in part regulated by hormonal and synaptic inputs. But it may not be. You can imagine that it might be some kind of oscillatory circuit because we know that they are regulated by serotonin. You know I think serotonin has multiple inputs and many effects on neurons.

There has also been interesting studies in  Xenopus, but these studies show that neuromodulators from descending modulatory neurons can really regulate networks of neurons that then will drive behavior and will maintain stable function. My view of the principal role of those neurons is to regulate activity within the nervous system of the animals. So this is the central role, which is to maintain functional connectivity. This includes maintaining structural connectivity, or that connectivity pattern, as well as functional connectivity, that is the pattern of activity between neurons that produces the behavior.

Some are passive transmitter-specific circuits. And then there are larger networks of circuits that are regulated by hormones and neurohormones.

So how would that be possible without neurohormone signaling? When I say neurohormones, I mean things like serotonin, not things like norepinephrine or something like that.

And this would be, uh, you're making a hard case because you're making it, uh, you are using the, the connection as primary and so on. And it's a very hard case to answer yes. Um, but here's another thing you, that you mentioned earlier, in the introduction to sort of the, uh, work that you are going to be talking about this evening.'",

Then you'd have more circuit connections on a circuit. And then that would make it more flexible, but then the neurons would have to cooperate, because they wouldn't all be independent networks.

Inhibition is always the default mode of operations in the brain to avoid going into an overly active state, which is not good for you or good for your neighbors. This is a really short, one cycle of time window that can help the brain to work at the right level. In addition to that, inhibition can reduce or eliminate all that excitation in a particular domain of a system, which can be incredibly useful as in a computer system.'",

So, your brain is like an organism because it has lots of neurons like neurons in your body and we should think of it as being a circuit and it has different parts, and he thought well we should have association areas as part of this circuit, and then when the microscope was invented he got to see these regions of the circuit that are surrounded by these association areas that actually look like little circuit components in themselves.

That although the synaptic connections in these areas are very complex, and most likely quite complicated, the activity of those synaptic interactions themselves, it appears, and it has been shown, it appears that those synaptic actions themselves actually occur on multiple time scales. There are two phases of a synaptic depression, and each one of those are different. So each individual synapse has more than one phase of depression, different timescales that contribute to that synaptic depression. And therefore, as you can see, these synaptic connections, these synapses may actually be subject to temporal and spatial variability. So we found during my work in particular at MIT, when I was in graduate school, there were synapse experiments that suggested that there was something that happened on one timescale, which was in the mill sec range, and something that happened on a longer timescale, which would be on the millisecond timescale.'",

Which is one of the states that one tends to find, when you are interested in the underlying mechanisms of oscillations in any form.

So we actually thought that the single-photon detectors would not count the spikes correctly when you have multiple spikes per burst. I started working on this a long time ago with the pyloric network, and as you know, there were just no neurons that responded with single spikes per burst, so, so what we thought was that it would be easy as we grew increasingly smarter to solve this problem but we couldn't figure out the solution so we actually ended up abandoning it as we were working on it because it wasn't going to exist.'",

For example, the network that is responsible for generating human cognition is composed of the neuron-combinator circuits. In particular the cell-fused neuron. This is a neuronal circuit in which we have three cells in a single cell. The three cells get connected by synapses, and in turn those three neurons get connected to multiple, smaller networks. So, this is the same neuron-combinatorial circuit you might use to generate brain cognition. And this circuit is integrated into the larger circuit.

Each of the elements of this problem needs to be able to be examined separately. For example, even the simplest puzzle of dots, if you are looking at this with an opto-electro-biophysical approach, you know if you just look at the individual pieces, you're going to want to know what each of those circuits of neurons would do. Each of those circuits of ionic channels or excitatory transmitter receptors, how they work together to solve this problem, because ultimately, you're solving this to make the connections. At the same time there is something bigger than that. Now, the larger part of that puzzle is, is the system to be able to solve those problems.'",

I think a couple times, and this is a little exaggeration, but he was probably the most renowned neuroscientist in the world, and he did experiments on the pyloric network of mice. And one of the fascinating studies was that he put mice into the pyloric pacemaker network either by himself or with people from the University of Kyoto, and what he found was that in about 40 seconds a mouse could, if he or she wanted to, develop muscle tension. So if he or she was asleep and had his or her pacemaker network with the mice, he or she could develop muscle tension. By themselves, mice could not maintain muscle tension for tens of seconds without maintaining a high-pitched, kind of squeaky sound.'",

The brain starts to make mistakes and the neurons start to go wrong, but we have learned many, many times that, even in pathological cases, even if you look at a brain which is generating all kinds of things that shouldn't be there, the brain still has enough underlying mechanisms to recover behaviorally robust output.

The biggest brains were needed to control the complex weapons to survive. The second family had very big brains of up to five inches in diameter. The larger the brain, the smarter the people; they invented music with pipes made from bone, a musical instrument that needed to be played over a long period of time. They had to work long hours just to produce one tool, but the tool served for many hours, so they gradually invented instruments and songs that became rhythmic. This was a big shift from the tool making to music. So in this transitional period, we had three brains. One for tool-making, another one for food-gathering, and one for communication.'",

So I've had many other fears, which I've now got used to, but the fear of how to die was very real. And a part of me was happy about it. I was not scared in the sense that, I have fear of heights, but not of dying. It was more like, oh, I'm going to end up in a loony bin, not ending up in the ground. Well, maybe this is a little irrational. I was not rational in high school. I was afraid of dying. But a lot of that fear may be rooted in this issue as well.'",

One might think, and some people will say the only the brain neurons contribute to these networks, but of course neurons are part of circuits that are also electrically synaptically active within circuit structures, right?

Even then, the first work with a neuron that was an identified neuron. The first work, first work with an identified neuron was just two years ago, so we are literally a couple years apart.

What are the most important discoveries? That's just a difficult thing to answer. And it's difficult, from my perspective as a little guy. And I'm a little guy of course.

And the brain has the, has the, the neurons that work and function as cells. But the brain also has neurons that work in concert with others. So as you know, if I look at the retina, when I look at the retinas of fruit flies, I see many different cell types. So retinal ganglia have many cell types.

In a recent experiment, we made a new brain-computer interface that allowed patients to control computers with brain activity recorded during a nap. This technology, which can allow people to do things in a non-sensory way, can do a great many things that would be useful for people who cannot effectively use traditional input and output devices.

The ability to monitor brain activity in intact brains and to develop tools that we didn't know about has been very, very exciting. And it has been possible to study the evolution of these circuits, too, so we have actually been able to track the evolution of this brain and how it evolved to become a fully functioning cortex. So, a very exciting century. You know, it had a few more downsides, but I am fascinated by how neurons work, how neurons interact with other cells, how neurons connect.

So if the pattern of activity in the neurons depends on the activity of one neuron, or two neuron types, you can't change it. And I just find interesting that neurons that use similar patterns of activity, that their patterns of activity depend on some intrinsic, intrinsic properties and not some other parameter imposed on them. Because it shows there is something about the neurons themselves that determine how they are behaving. But then also the way that the different neurons are connected, you know they are acting in a coordinated fashion.'",

We see many different intrinsic and synaptic conductances with properties that are not defined by their synaptic inputs. We see a wide variety of receptor types and we see neuromodulators that have their receptors on neurons in many neurons. We also see neurons with many projections and neuromodulators and synaptic connections that go many different ways. So, you know, I think maybe in the future we're going to see that the most significant insight we're going to get is when we understand that the brain is more of an environment for learning and behaviour in terms of evolution and learning.

I'm sure you are aware that the discovery of the genetic code and its role in molecular biology revolutionized the world. At the same time, the discoveries of molecular biology transformed neuroscience. Today, we have the tools that are needed for a second era of molecular biology/neuroscience that can create even more interesting solutions. So the big challenge is not only to understand the neural syntactical rules that are expressed in various brain rhythms, but to understand how those specific neural syntax can be used to generate specific patterns in the brain. Understanding how neural syntax could be used towards such a goal would be the big advantage of science. But, as just mentioned, all those technical details we have to understand require the implementation of more modern techniques such as optogenetics and high-density probes.'",

We discovered that every neuron was a separate unit, separate from all other neurons in the brain, each uniquely defined, and each with a small number of properties, but each with enough unique properties to determine how that part of the brain would function. Of course we had anticipated that the brain had cells with unique properties, and our original interest had been in understanding the properties of different neurons, but these unique properties of neurons lead us to appreciate that these neurons aren't just components that get put together, but they contain their own unique machinery.

We can look for mechanisms and use our experimental findings as an anchor for theoretical research, which can be conducted either with neuroimaging or in other laboratories. What do we need to understand in order to understand? What do we want to understand? I don't have to understand the brains hardware, but it wouldn't be impossible if we understand how the circuits work together.

My mentor, Hans Berger, was already extremely cautious about that. After dinner, we would go down to where Bergers had his laboratory located. We had to climb up his stairs up to the laboratory. All we could see was the back wall. For me, the most fun part of those sessions was when Bergers would take out his sledgehammer and strike at the wall.

And it was a breakthrough because now we can look at the brain and what is the real basis of the brain-how neurons make the brain-and that was a huge insight, but only after there was a lot more work. This is what I would like to do. There is so much and how the brain makes the brain that to really go by, I would like to take a long, long journey and not come back to the beginning.

And so the way to go about developing this model is to put the brains all over the globe and find the species for sure. But I agree that you also want to know exactly how the brains will work, it will be incredibly valuable for you to do the experiments in the brain because you'll understand the brain. But it's going to be extremely valuable for us to be able to bring the tools and technology that we have. And so maybe I'm saying you can look at these things together.

There are many different neuron types, because neurons are a specific type of cells that have been identified. Some neurons have three different types of channels. And so you don't need to learn how each of the neurons operate if they're different, right, because you know, one of the interesting things about neurons is you know, different neurons have all different types of components and it's important to identify them even though they're always named differently.

So network, you're asking about networks of neurons that are active together, so is they have connections to both cells that are different or that have connections from different modulatory neurons. And so many of the network functions that we know are important are actually the network architecture, the dynamics of the networks themselves. They require that the nodes of the networks have connections to other modules that then make them responsive to the changes, so for example in terms of networks, say how many neurotransmitters do you know that are released by different neurons and influence the brain circuitry. Not just one but probably more than one. The neural syntax has to be well organized in terms of the interactions between neurons.'",
