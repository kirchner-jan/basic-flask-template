Dr. Buzsaki's primary interests is 'neural syntax', i.e., how segmentation of neural information is organized by the numerous brain rhythms to support cognitive functions. Dr. Marder studies the dynamics of small neuronal networks, and her work was instrumental in demonstrating that neuronal circuits are not 'hard-wired' but can be reconfigured by neuromodulatory neurons and substances to produce a variety of outputs. The two are having a public academic panel discussion about the function of the higher-order-cortex.\n-BEGIN TRANSCRIPT-\n",

But you actually see, during aging, when the mice lose their capacity for rhythmic behavior, when one of the neurons goes down for a long period of time, when you activate it again, it produces rhythmic behavior, that it provides some sort of an additional drive that the neurons can use. So, it is actually believed that the higher cortical centers are in a cycle, they are part and parcel of the larger process of generating rhythmic behavior, as all the network dynamics that produce rhythmic behavior are themselves regulated rhythmically.'",

It's possible that, if you put a large number of electrodes in the brain without knowing what brain responses you're expecting, you might find the brains activity resembles, if anything, the patterns of the motor cortex or the somatosensory cortex, where the motor cortex, for example, it doesn't produce the motor behavior but it's perfectly able to predict that behavior of the output muscles, and the somatosensic cortex doesn't produce the somatosensa behavior but perfectly able to predict the outcome of motor cortex activity. For example, it will be able to generate output motor pattern. So we have to be careful. We have to make sure that we actually have in our possession a brain response that actually does what it is supposed to do.'",

For example, when you're recording from the motor cortex, you have to actually, you have to be absolutely sure that you're recording a brain neuron that is a motor neuron, something that makes muscles contract, because you cannot tell whether a brain neuron is a motor neuron unless you've identified it. It's really a very difficult problem because there are so many ways to identify neurons from the brain if they are not motor neurons. They can be identified and sorted so completely that you can be absolutely sure that it will react to the modulators that you're looking for. In terms of whether or not the higher order cortex is doing these things and regulating them so I'm not, I don't know that these data will help you prove that you're dealing with a single population or a multiple population.'",

And in principle that gives enough clues so that we can say, well, then it's the activity of the higher order cortex that's responsible for it. It's actually an incredibly powerful approach because it allows us to do a lot more than we could ever really do by having access to the raw neurophysics.'"

That although the synaptic connections in these areas are very complex, and most likely quite complicated, the activity of those synaptic interactions themselves, it appears, and it has been shown, it appears that those synaptic actions themselves actually occur on multiple time scales. There are two phases of a synaptic depression, and each one of those are different. So each individual synapse has more than one phase of depression, different timescales that contribute to that synaptic depression. And therefore, as you can see, these synaptic connections, these synapses may actually be subject to temporal and spatial variability. So we found during my work in particular at MIT, when I was in graduate school, there were synapse experiments that suggested that there was something that happened on one timescale, which was in the mill sec range, and something that happened on a longer timescale, which would be on the millisecond timescale.'"

This is interesting because the hippocampus is the brain structure with the largest reservoir of synaptic connections. The hippocampus is also a very complex structure with very large recurrent collateral systems and very large axons. And this is indeed true in humans, as well as in other mammals. However, the hippocampus is one single neural module, and it can be conceptualized as having a synaptic and circuit arrangement, consisting of a large recurrent network and multiple layers.'"

And we are finding that as the network changes, it is possible for you to activate a different part of the network, and that, therefore, the higher-order function of the network may also change. Of course, a good example of this is in the retina, because the retina, which has evolved over tens of millions of years for very particular functions, is part of a larger circuit that enables you to see. So, just as vision evolved during evolution, and as different neurons evolved different functions, and so forth with the retina and its function, you have these large circuit modules that have been modified to support these other functions.'"

And the Vp also contains many sensory structures that you can see. We would actually look at the Vp and see the lateral nerve as it enters, the dorsal lateral ventricular nerve and the V2 and then we would just look at the Vd because we wanted to see the dorsal ventral lateral nerve, as it emerged.

So, your brain is like an organism because it has lots of neurons like neurons in your body and we should think of it as being a circuit and it has different parts, and he thought well we should have association areas as part of this circuit, and then when the microscope was invented he got to see these regions of the circuit that are surrounded by these association areas that actually look like little circuit components in themselves.

Which is one of the states that one tends to find, when you are interested in the underlying mechanisms of oscillations in any form.

And what came up first is the case of the simplest oscillators: the relaxation oscillators in which the oscillator phase and phase of the relaxation are exactly the same at the time of the maximum input or the amplitude of the population rhythm.

Inhibition is always the default mode of operations in the brain to avoid going into an overly active state, which is not good for you or good for your neighbors.

So by controlling the membrane potential, inhibition is not able to affect things in the downstream excitatory system and excitation or downstream excitatory activity. And this is important because this is where I have some reservations about the way inhibition can be approached and exploited for their, uh, purpose. That is to not get so very active, as the hyperpolarized membrane state and hyperpolarized neurons can also be very dangerous. That's the way inhibition is always viewed as a sort of a, uh, a, uh, at a glance a mechanism - or perhaps a more appropriate definition is that inhibition is a mechanism, whose primary job is to prevent activation or prevent getting in an overly active state.'"

We know that the other mammals for example have cortices that sense food but have not that temperature sensitivity. But this part of the brain, which is temperature sensitive in the mouse, is involved in all sorts of different functions. So, I really don't know how useful this brain was for the mouse to have this temperature sensitive part of its brain.

The same kind of integration has been seen in biological systems. The neuron does not only fire action potentials but integrates the activity to determine your state of being.

They'll fire one neuron, the rest won't. And you just think about a neuron firing one time out of five and then the rest are always silent. Then you connect those neurons to neurons that are firing, that are part of the cortex, and you connect them to a network of neurons, and you start calculating things. You then have to figure out that how a neuron that fires once in every five milliseconds interacts with a neuron that fires more than every three milliseconds and how you can calculate how long of a time period it'll take to integrate.

So, it has the ability to make guesses from limited data about the relationships and relationships between the environments and the behaviors of its sensors. So when you go with its sensors in action and, well, in the absence of any other sensory inputs, it senses in a more detailed way what goes out in the environment that the brain would be sensing and what goes onto the sensors.

Some are passive transmitter-specific circuits. And then there are larger networks of circuits that are regulated by hormones and neurohormones.

So how would that be possible without neurohormone signaling? When I say neurohormones, I mean things like serotonin, not things like norepinephrine or something like that. What I mean is these regulatory hormones that can adjust the activity of some neuron types and allow the activity of other neurons to be effectively modulated by this hormone.

And the hippocampus sends out an activity packets in response to that activity packet during sharp wave ripples. It's the hippocampus-initiated process that allows for the retrieval of memory traces and the replay of such memories during sleep, during the consolidation of our memories.

So, this is different from a study that was done about  Drosophila, because there are different subtypes of neurons.

You know that depends on how I think about this, because if you cut off these neurons, you would lose not only the electrical output but the central pattern generator. So if you want to change how fast or slow the central pattern generator runs, the only way you can do that is to change the intrinsic properties of the neurons in this area. 'So the other main component of this cortex is the d.p.s. These are the neurons that regulate gastric mill rhythm. These are the three neurons that control the stomach, and the stomach is the biggest, you know, it's got all of the guts of the animal, and some of them are more or less permanently active, and others are temporary.

So not being passive detectors of information but to generate feedback and control the activity of the circuit. I think that would also apply to larger networks. So your system might need to have some control properties for tuning the network. You know what I think it could also be. The other thing that occurs to me would be when you make a model of neural circuits that you make a model that is going to help you understand how it works.

So the voltage signal that they are putting out is probably a tonic firing that is in part regulated by hormonal and synaptic inputs. But it may not be. You can imagine that it might be some kind of oscillatory circuit because we know that they are regulated by serotonin. You know I think serotonin has multiple inputs and many effects on neurons. So what's likely to happen is is they are likely to produce stable patterns that are consistent with their regulatory input and synaptic input and hormonal input.'"

That is, once it has received the synaptic information from other neurons, it is actually going to release a molecule that is going to block the neurotransmission at the synaptic terminal when its GABAergic activity has a high-enough level. And in the case of SST neuro-transmitters, the timing of release at the synaptic input would be strictly under the control of a molecular clock: a circadian clock, which is in synchrony with the other functions in the brain. This is a very exciting aspect of this mechanism because it has all the necessary properties to serve a particular function, a special function. It works well in a well-dissolved manner. It is very responsive, and it is highly effective.'",

You know, the neurons might be silent because their neurotransmitters aren't doing their usual functions, or they might be suppressed because other neurons in some sort of network might be active. So you got neurons that might not be present or even working when you need them but we really should not allow neurons to have to be constantly regulated by a lot of other neurons or neurons in our brain.

I do' not want to answer that is not a well-thought-out question, but it is a question I have started in my mind since the beginning. And it really has been bothering me.

So, I think that is definitely important, and I don't think that's been addressed enough in the discussion of why the cortex has this type of cell type. I think that a big thing that I've been working on recently that is very interesting: We think about regulatory sequences, and regulatory sequences are not necessarily constrained in the way that it has traditionally been thought they would be.

I mean, the reason that you want to create a neuron during development that is capable of being regulated properly during development is very different, but again it's a kind of constraint you can use. So, that was a big area I started to look into was regulatory sequences, this idea that if you have a neuron in your brain that is not regulated properly, it will not behave properly. And I discovered that if you take the regulatory sequences from an example neuron that is being regulated correctly, and you introduce them into a different neuron, you can make the cell behave like the original neuron, but the regulatory sequences that are required for function are often not present.'",

So, the other big difference is that neurons do not have multiple action potentials, they have a single action potential.

And there are many, many types of cell where when the neurons are not active, the APs are suppressed. But these neurons have a unique feature because when they get excited, they will excite the other neurons in the network, or excite themselves \u2013 so when they fire, they fire not because of their intrinsic excitability. So, they can fire because of the other neurons firing.

When you are interacting with the outside world, when you are interacting with your body, with your digestion, with your muscles, it is very easy to lose track. There are very few places that are absolutely protected from stimulation. The other part of it is that even when we are not sensing through muscle, the brain is always alert for any sensory input. It has to be alert, and so to protect it from stimulation you have to turn down some activity so that a steady stream of information can reach the cortex.'",

We take the mice from the population of these animals, of which we have done experiments on all kinds, and we then take two of these intact mice and we take these two mice and we disconnect everything. We then make it possible that they must rely on each other and on their direct neighbors as far as their sensory and motor input is concerned. So then these muscles are removed. They still have their brains. The two animals do not talk to each other. When we then introduce them back into the population, they immediately jump into a large group of mice and become indistinguishable from one another. So now we have two-year-old mice who are behaving exactly the same as old mice.'"

But they do not fire the motor neurons, because they receive descending excitatory synaptic drive from another subnetwork, and then they stimulate the motor neurons. That's where the action potentials come from that are used to generate a rhythm that is sort of central to the network. It provides a rhythmic, robust and strong pacemaker for the network.

And they can be in a closed loop, since you don't have to put in that action potential at every single time of the cycle, but in this case, it is closed-loop, because they fire once and their mechanism is a bit different: the inhibition comes from a second subnetwork, which is responsible for the inhibition-induced inhibition that in essence, it becomes a closed loop.

I think there's been an interesting study in mice that shows that the main task of those higher cortical neurons is to help and maintain functional brain circuit function. There has also been interesting studies in  Xenopus, but these studies show that neuromodulators from descending modulatory neurons can really regulate networks of neurons that then will drive behavior and will maintain stable function. My view of the principal role of those neurons is to regulate activity within the nervous system of the animals. So this is the central role, which is to maintain functional connectivity. This includes maintaining structural connectivity, or that connectivity pattern, as well as functional connectivity, that is the pattern of activity between neurons that produces the behavior. The brain can tolerate variability in activity without compromising the behavior.'"

I'm not so sure what the actual function of the association areas is on the primary axis, because the primary axis is defined by the central pattern-generating elements in the cortex. They are important for the maintenance of the rhythm, for the generation of rhythmic motor patterns, but I'm thinking their main function is to provide the synaptic connections and sensory components for sensory perception.'"

I don't know the name of all these, I'll just call them sensory nodes, because they do have more to them. They have more to do with filtering, filtering of sensory inputs from the outside. So a lot of what we thought we were working on for sensory-to-motor conversion was wrong we thought this was all the same network. This is important. So for instance, we used to think this was all in synaptic connections between the neurons, and we used to think that the synaptic connections between the neuron were graded by the strength, just like in the synaptic connections in the spinal cord, or elsewhere, and we used this to study neural variability. So we used this to figure out how robust our nervous systems could be, how variable our nervous systems might be, and so on.'"
