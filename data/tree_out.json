  "name": "The following is a transcript of a conversation between the two famous neuroscientists Dr. Buzsaki and Dr. Marder. Dr. Buzsaki's primary interests is 'neural syntax', i.e., how segmentation of neural information is organized by the numerous brain rhythms to support cognitive functions. Dr. Marder studies the dynamics of small neuronal networks, and her work was instrumental in demonstrating that neuronal circuits are not 'hard-wired' but can be reconfigured by neuromodulatory neurons and substances to produce a variety of outputs. The following is a transcript from a public academic panel discussion between the two.\n-BEGIN TRANSCRIPT-\n",

If you decrease excitatory output, then the neuron would be quieter, but there would be less of the excitatory inputs from other neurons to the neuron. So it is a mechanism, and it's a device. So we should ask, what are the functions of inhibition? Why do we need inhibition? How does it come into play?'",

They do release substances, but I think they probably just increase the release of those substances by the neuron that is receiving the inhibitory signal. I do believe they are important because they control the release of substances by the neurons that they are inhibiting, so they make them release more substances.

The long-term potentiating effect lasts for hours, whereas the depression effect is a rapid change of synaptic strength over a period of a few minutes. Is this correct? It would be interesting if we were to know what causes the long-term potenti-ation, but what causes the depression, and we can compare them.'",

So, if we look at the neural syntax and how the neural circuits are put together, there are three levels, and the first level of that is the network that we've discussed before, the first level is the circuitry of the neurons and their relationships to each other and to their connections. The second level is the interactions between neural cells and circuits and the mechanisms by which these cells, these neurons and circuit neurons, the circuits control behavior.'",
