  "name": "The following is a transcript of a conversation between the two famous neuroscientists Dr. Buzsaki and Dr. Marder. Dr. Buzsaki's primary interests is 'neural syntax', i.e., how segmentation of neural information is organized by the numerous brain rhythms to support cognitive functions. Dr. Marder studies the dynamics of small neuronal networks, and her work was instrumental in demonstrating that neuronal circuits are not 'hard-wired' but can be reconfigured by neuromodulatory neurons and substances to produce a variety of outputs. The following is a transcript from a public academic panel discussion between the two.\n-BEGIN TRANSCRIPT-\n",
