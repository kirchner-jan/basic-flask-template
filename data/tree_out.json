  "name": "The following is a transcript of a conversation between the two famous neuroscientists Dr. Buzsaki and Dr. Marder. Dr. Buzsaki's primary interests is 'neural syntax', i.e., how segmentation of neural information is organized by the numerous brain rhythms to support cognitive functions. Dr. Marder studies the dynamics of small neuronal networks, and her work was instrumental in demonstrating that neuronal circuits are not 'hard-wired' but can be reconfigured by neuromodulatory neurons and substances to produce a variety of outputs. The two are having a public academic panel discussion about the function of the higher-order-cortex.\n-BEGIN TRANSCRIPT-\n",

And all connections, including the brain connections, are based on the connection of the nerves. The connection of the nerves is based on the activity of the spinal cord, which is a giant mass of uncoordinated neurons. But how would uncoordinated neurons connect to each other?'",

If you ever look through a microscope in the brain, you will be amazed about the complexity of the neuron types.

Those neurons are so simple that they have five branches. At the base of each ramification, the bouton is packed with excitatory postsynaptic chemical receptors, which allows my neighbors to talk to me. In my lab, I have trained a lot of students what is a layer 6 pyramidal cell. Our students are good at these simple-cell-type tasks.

So this would be a practical way of testing how a hypothetical wiring-based computation does something without having to design their own wiring.

This is where network dynamics, for example, is very critical for the outcome in this kind of a complicated case.

My first observation is that if you put a mouse with a group of mice and let it live, the activity in its brain changes because the animal has to respond to its own body. As a mouse starts with a basal level of activity, like it gets to wake up in the light or it gets frightened by some noise, one or two or three or four of these things, this animal might spend all day running around and looking for small targets and chewing the lumps off of sticks for no significant purpose. Once it starts having to deal with itself, then you start getting more and more of this kind of activity as the animal gets used to controlling its own movement in the brain. This may or may not lead the animal to begin to realize that it has purposeful abilities beyond being a small mouse living in some hole. It may not.'",

Maybe each neuron projects to several different neurons. So, how do you look at a single neuron, and say \"the neuron is doing this in the cortex\"?'",

And we were trying to see if we could get the different circuits of neurons, neurons that are involved in brain processes, like emotion, to come in synchrony with each other. We didn't think that was possible. But we thought that we would be able to understand the brain by doing the measurements, getting single neurons, working with multiple neurons, that you've done so elegantly in your experiments.'",

So here is  a simple circuit, and it is the circuit that is connected to a motor neuron and the motor neuron's primary goal is to exert an action.  Now, this is simply a very simple circuit. It has only a motor neuron. It does not have any intermediate or higher-order-layer neurons, and so it requires that the activity of the interneurons be maintained synchronously and they are in the right time window. But here is  a more complicated circuit, where the two main goals of the lower-order-layer and the higher-order neurons and  the inhibitory interneurons are maintained synchronously.'",

So I think there is a purpose of evolution of the cortex that has something to do with functions. So for example, we have this problem to solve, this problem of understanding perception. Perception in humans has changed and evolved over time. In fact, a couple of years ago we looked at a study and we found that humans of different races show differences in perception. So for example African-Americans tend to be better at perception than the other races. Whites and Americans. So we were interested in seeing whether maybe the same thing is happening in a laboratory monkey. So we tested whether monkeys in the laboratory could perceive and behave appropriately as their species did in their normal environments. We found they couldn't.'",

So we found that the central pattern generators, as you may know, are sensitive to temperature.

So there was a huge difference between cold-blooded mammals like the crab that can regulate their temperature by shivering and thermoregulating animals that can't regulate their temperature. They might be freezing cold and have a seizure; their brains might get cold and have a breakdown, you know. So there are different issues with temperature, with neurons having to do with their ability to generate action potentials. They have to do with how their membrane behaves.

So therefore, brain activity will be affected. So the question is whether we will observe those changes when the brain is cold because it can be cold in the laboratory for a long time period of time and be able to respond to temperature. So the question really is whether we can observe it, you know.

They allow for integration to other neurons, allowing them to have feedback control. Well, one of the functions of the association areas on in the mouse cortex is to provide for electrical coupling between neurons. So, all of the cortical neurons are electrically coupled to each other through an extensive network of the associated ganglia, through the stomatogastric nerve. So, there is electrical coupling between all of these nervous systems. So, you're giving me electrical coupling, so to allow electrical conduction to take place from cell to cell in a network, and back up to the brain. So, and these are two different mechanisms, that are different types of electrical coupling, and may serve slightly different purposes in the network in some aspects.

So, there are various, but mainly two types of electrophysiological coupling of electrically charged ions or molecules, of a charged molecule, and a charged medium. And that is electroneutrality. And that is the fundamental mechanism of electrical coupling. So when we go back to the question of the primary motivation? The primary motivation for this electric coupling is to allow for electrical communication with a charged group of electrically charged molecules. Not electrically charged molecules, but electrically charged molecules between those electrically charged molecules to have electromagnetic communication. Again. So, what is our motivation? What is the primary goal that we're looking to achieve? We have a variety of different, electrical connections between neurons and glial cells in the brain.'",

When a stimulus comes in through a single sensory or motor neuron, it has nowhere to go, because it has sensory circuits and motor circuits. If you take this network itself, if a stimulus comes through a neuropil, a small aperture that's in the head between the fore- and the central-fornixes, through the pyloric dilator nerve that goes through the lateral ventrical, you can open it up and you can look into the posterior ventrial nerve, which opens up to the association areas where the small motor networks and the small sensory networks are actually in direct contact with each other. The association area is filled with nerves that branch into tiny processes and make direct contact with neurons in the individual networks.'",

So these neurons are already electrically coupled, and then are electrically coupled to other neurons such as the cell body. And then these axons are coupled to their respective target neurons. So their electrical coupling already exists, and thus you can see that there is an increase in capacitance, a voltage-dependent capacitance.

I think in any kind of circuit, whether it's a neuronal circuit or a circuit of muscles, there is always a central coordinating hub, and it's important to ensure that this hub receives enough inhibitory as well as electrical input from all of the other elements in the circuit. It might think that we could get away with a simple hub that simply inhibits all neurons, or if we were studying invertebrates where there're only one brain, we could try and get away with a hub that inhibits all the neurons.

It's very good that you ask me this question, because you are not the only one to ask this question. Every day we get people ask us about the role of different network features, other than the network itself, because it is very clear that a network can have different sets of rules that give it different functions. So now, I believe the primary purpose of those association networks is to provide the information-processing capabilities that are required for the development of thought and behaviour. So I think that the primary purpose of many of those features in the cortex, besides supporting the activity that is required for the functions of neural activity, is to generate information, to produce synaptic connections, to maintain synaptic connections, to activate, to regulate and to inhibit and to coordinate the neural activity throughout the brain.'",

I feel that the function of inhibition is to select, to limit and to control the activity of the neural assembly. And the cortex is such a great example of this, where inhibition can select whether the activity will be amplified or reduced (or the primary function is to divide) and it can limit the activity of a network, but when the brain itself is providing the inhibition, that activity becomes an amplifier that can regulate the activity of the network. So in a way, that inhibition has a dual function: to divide and to amplify and combine the activity.'",

Or do these nuclei have a special role, which cannot be replicated using only the cortex, and the rest of the brain can evolve and provide enough complexity?

And also in any nervous system there are often different network configurations. So in a neural network, as well as neurons, you find there will be networks that have either a number of single neurons that have a single cell excitation, or they have a number of different neurons that are firing. And it is necessary for the circuit to remain intact that all those neurons inhibit each neuron at a rate that is appropriate to the time constants of the network, so that the network can fire either a tonic rhythm, or a normal rhythm, where it maintains an appropriate timing to facilitate behaviour. So it is necessary to have a functional inhibitory network, and I do think the primary purpose is to be functional.

And that cannot be answered easily because most of the stuff we do we do because of the external influence.

And so some of the most important neurons that regulate circuits are the Pyloric Dilator (PD) neurons, because these are very important neurons that regulate the circuit dynamics of the pyloric circuit.

And, of course, there are also the mechanisms of the neuromodulatory projection neurons that release substances that enter into the brain.

Although the role of neuromodulators is not yet fully clarified, because, clearly, the brain is not behaving like muscle fibers when it moves and it is active at the same time that it is behaving. So clearly there are multiple purposes that might be served by these projections, either to excite and initiate other neurons, or to regulate the electrical properties of a neuron or a circuit, or to create a feedback that regulates the intrinsic properties of that particular neuron as it develops.'",

And syncytia are basically like small clusters of neurons that are very closely interdependent. The synapses between neurons that make these interdependent networks happen are not really well studied yet. It's a different kind of information that you lose if you just look into individual cells. So it's interesting to know how much information and function is lost if you only look into individual neurons. We can't understand how neurons work yet to their fullest extent if we just look into the individual neurons, if the neurons just have to do only one thing. So it's important to me that the neurons know where they're going'. They know where their role is in the nervous system and how they're going to play that role.'",

We used to think we had circuits and that if you knew enough that you could measure all of the currents that were in the circuit.

And you can call that, call those internalized brain states, like the hippocampus, enthrasis, attention, and what not. So by looking at it from this angle, then there are always neuronal changes and their consequences across these states and their boundaries. And that, uh, that could be the function of the cortex as a whole.'",

So, let me throw out what I'm looking for out, and we'll try to figure out the consequences. So in his classic paper, the two-faced neurons of cortex with long axons, David McCormick, he said the primary goal of local connections in the brain is to serve function. At the other extreme of the spectrum, I would go back to Francis Bacon and say that the primary goal of the brain is to generate a particular output. So what is that and where are the inputs? Now, we have the input, for example, from the eyes or from the ears or from the taste buds, but we don't have an association area for taste even in our neocortex that could coordinate the local response of our taste buds if they were to respond to stimuli and they were to respond differentially based on their distance from it.'",

When we take one part of the brain, which is not quite known what it does or what functions it supports, and put it together all the neurons in this part, and then make these neurons disappear, we will have a clue as to what the original functions were. Now, this is an oversimplification, but it is a reasonable thing I would say. So, you will say, well, the neurons that form the network are good enough to be important and to be used in a brain network, but if you don't identify them, then they may not be able to function as a network or a single unit, which is what we call information transmission.'",

I think there's plenty of work saying the connectivity isn't perfect, but it's much better than random. Even randomness as a circuit would be dangerous because these different neurons have different properties, and if they do not all develop very closely coordinated behavior they could be dangerous for each other, and so forth. But my feeling is that each neuron develops its own property. One has an axonal projection to another neuron, has electrical synapses to other neurons, has other electrical synapses, has its own conductances.'",

I would also add that as somebody who's worked in computational neural networks, it would be interesting to know the nature of the network that exists in the association areas. So in principle, what would it do if we looked at it. So let me start, but I would add, though, that if you look at the neocortex in a broader sense, and the whole network, it's really much more of a substrate. So, in particular, what kind of network connectivity are there through those neurons? Are they random or structured? And what is the functional connectivity in the whole cortex?'",

Of course, it's also influenced by synaptic strengths, and that kind of stuff.

For example, this brain here has got a primary role and I'm going to describe you the whole story but it has got a primary function. I mean, what primary functions, we can't tell you the primary function of this brain because we don't know what inputs and feedback that this brain got but we can guess it might be involved in vision, because presumably it got some visual input.

So what a primary function might be is that this brain has a function that isn't primary but it is an extension of the primary function so that's the difference between \"the primary function is not obvious\", or at least it's not apparent in the brain but the extension is easy to explain in terms of the structure of the brain.'",

And to be a, the primary decision maker, requires a brain that works with and takes into consideration both the sensory area and the prefrontal cortex, and the neocortex of course, and the brain. And it gives you the highest power over choice. But it also seems that we have to have another brain mechanism, another option for choice that is much less, uh, we have to have a mechanism that would control the decisions. And we have two options that are basically similar: and there seems to be some tension between these options. If a system can either be controlled by external input, or the ability to control internal decision, then there is only one function that those structures can do. And it's to influence behavior and direct perception.'",

So many times in biology it's the case where we know you have this part of the cell, and we know that it is important for the function, but we don't necessarily know exactly how it is used by the cell. A large example is with synaptic inhibitory activity in animals and humans. The synaptic activity of inhibitory synapses is important for muscle contraction or muscle contraction, but not for muscle relaxation. It can also provide the inhibition to the gastric mill rhythm, which is essential for digestion. Right? So the nervous system uses a variety of electrical synapses to maintain function. It uses it to keep the rhythms alive, it uses it to modulate or change the properties of neurons, and that's why it really is so important.'",

You have to work together, and you have to work in time, which is perhaps a fundamental thing that we still haven't solved. Of course, there would be a lot of reasons to solve if the neural syntax would be known. And the way that it would be solved is if we would have a good idea of what information the neurons are communicating in their spikes and how they are being transmitted. Right?

The way that is it is happening in the hippocampus, which is a complex, complex system, but it's a synchronized population of neurons. And when you are looking at many neuronal assemblies in this small population, they are sending a different set of messages that the other neurons are receiving. And there are these very critical mechanisms that allow those messages to be processed. It's probably similar in the cerebral cortex. And the messages are also being processed. All these issues must be dealt with when we are thinking about how to understand the function of the brain as it is now.

It also changes synaptic weights; it changes circuit dynamics.

But neurons, by definition, are found in both the nervous system and the periphery, so that can provide independent checks about how robust the system should be. I think my main concern is not to do it in principle, because it's certainly possible to do, but to provide a picture because we understand the brain. That's the issue. We want to understand how the brain works and understand how it's connected to other parts and how it makes decisions and solves problems.

We studied a cortex where there would be at least a triphasic rhythm of pyloric neurons, and there were many such that when we put these triphasic neurons in isolation, they would only do a quasiflick in isolation. So we put them all in one culture, and they were all stimulated simultaneously, so we put all the neurons that could be activated from one neuron at the same time, and when the entire set of neurons was stimulated, they would emit a series of spikes, one at a time, but the relative timing between the spikes was correct to form a triphasic sequence.'",

When they are first evolving, they're small circuits, and then they grow, and then the larger circuits grow around them, but if the smaller circuits are there as part of the larger circuit, then they can grow with it and can remain useful functions to support, sort of, neural processing in the larger circuit.'

I have many experiments that contradict that, for example that the temporal lobe in humans is very important - we know that the temporal lobe is extremely important in the processing and interpreting of information.

A lot of work was done on the brain at the end of the 19th century when they separated these out one by one. So then you know the association areas are separate groups of neurons or neurons. And then we started to go down as far as to look at the different neuronal elements and their connectivity. And it turns out like, especially in these model organisms, like, when you look at the mouse and the drosophila stomatogastric ganglion (STG), and it's only got like seven neurons in the STG. So you know it's got like three pacemaker neurons. Because when neural activity was shown to these groups of neurons there were three pacemaker neurons that had this activity that turned on a bunch of other neurons. So then we realized that these were network neurons, that all these neurons had connectivity.'",

And there are many many things, many ways to make connections. Let's take a look at the higher-order areas of the cortex. What are they? Are there any rules? Is each area similar? What determines the function of that area? What does it do? Is there any other function? Can we figure out what other functions there might be, even though those functions have yet to be described? If you go to the higher-order cortical areas, it will be there to do so. These are some of the questions I would like to ask. And these are the questions that I have asked that this time of the podcast has a neuroscientist. Dr. Steve Strogatz is a professor at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York.'",
