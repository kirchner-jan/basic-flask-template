  "name": "The following is a transcript of a conversation between the two famous neuroscientists Dr. Buzsaki and Dr. Marder. Dr. Buzsaki's primary interests is 'neural syntax', i.e., how segmentation of neural information is organized by the numerous brain rhythms to support cognitive functions. Dr. Marder studies the dynamics of small neuronal networks, and her work was instrumental in demonstrating that neuronal circuits are not 'hard-wired' but can be reconfigured by neuromodulatory neurons and substances to produce a variety of outputs. The two are having a public academic panel discussion about the function of the higher-order-cortex.\n-BEGIN TRANSCRIPT-\n",

And what will also be easier is to study brain cells, for example, because these cells that you see in the brain or you see in the nervous system, they can be identified, they can be studied, they can be manipulated, they can be removed.'",
