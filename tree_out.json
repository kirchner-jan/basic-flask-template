  "name": "The following is a transcript of a conversation between the two famous neuroscientists Dr. Alfred and Dr. Bert. Dr. Alfred's primary interests is 'neural syntax', i.e., how segmentation of neural information is organized by the numerous brain rhythms to support cognitive functions. Dr. Bert studies the dynamics of small neuronal networks, and her work was instrumental in demonstrating that neuronal circuits are not 'hard-wired' but can be reconfigured by neuromodulatory neurons and substances to produce a variety of outputs. The two are having a casual academic conversation about the function of the higher-order-cortex.\n-BEGIN TRANSCRIPT-\n",

Because in the brain there's nothing special about single neurons' properties, not in the sense of some primitives, perhaps, but not in the sense that each cell is its own atom, an individuated single entity.

What I'm suggesting is that the short paths through the brain are often found by following local topographic connections, local connectivity, local dynamics. Now when we use this way of looking at things, we quickly see that it is a case where the path that we're asking to take, to represent the world as a combination of the primitives that we already have, is not quite as efficient as other path that comes back out again and again.'",

Because if you could, then in principle you could actually try, then you could maybe see how this path works out, and then you can say, I've got a candidate for the shortest path through the cortex. So where should we start at in order to learn about the shortest path through these two neurons' connection?

Of course we are shocked because people have thought of grid cells as a fundamental element of spatial navigation. And suddenly we realize that it's not an elementary thing any more that grid cells are something special, that there's a special cell type, a simple cell type, and the other cell types represent different things in this environment.

We have learned how to prepare the slices without touching the tissue, because the goal is to have a smooth cortex surface, which is essential if there are to be any neurons with a high density of ion channels or synapses on them. And every now and then we get something that looks like that. In the last paper I published in 2011 we were able to show that the higher parietal (which in the cat gets subdivided into Bregma area, which is the frontal associational area) cortex, which is rather distant from the olefactory groove area, indeed has its highest number of ion channels in layer 5B, not in layer 5W \u2013 which is the associational area.

As you know, for example, some neurons are active in the auditory cortex when a sound is played. This may, in principle, be computed as an input-output combination of a sound and a spike. However, there are other ways of processing, maybe for instance, visual signals. And again, there are many ways of processing of vision. And so if an output in the auditory cortex would be a fundamental requirement for an associational area, it is hard to imagine that the association area is useful in the eyesight. And it's important to remember that when you associate a feature, you must be able to classify it in order to do so.

However, there is no question that they do one thing and one thing, which is perhaps a very simple fundamental function.

It must be a function that has, in principle, the same output for, say, a picture of a cat or of a banana, or of a human face.

But that's not what we have to do. What most of us want to do is to bring back a representation from the outside world in the form of a mental image.  Because that's what our sensors give us. In a sense, that's what they actually do.  If you look at the way we view the brain, the brain can only give us some kind of representation.

So, um, therefore you've got multiple associations.  And that's very different from saying that you can combine the associative items into a set of items and that these associative items all have to refer to distinct items and the set of items they refer to is somehow distinct from the other set of items with which they are associated, in other words, if the sets are discrete, which you would have to say is a distinct constellation of neurons in at least one brain structure.'",

The neurons do that, and they are triggered. So they would be the brain and they would be the, the engine. If we go further, I'll give your case some thought.

But if the entire cerebral cortex receives information from movement command areas, it can then use the signals from these areas to compute all your actions without even looking at anything, and therefore these association areas are called 'higher order'. When a higher order area becomes a higher order cortex, what you have is a single cortex that is acting both as an input system and as an output system, and if so the term association cortex becomes obsolete, but that doesn't mean the cortical information will stop being divided in many parallel processing streams.'",

It sounded so much nicer, and I found it interesting. After all, the areas that can sense eye movements, which are called visual association areas, have nothing to do whatsoever with vision. But how did the brain learn to relate eye movements to visual perception? What does it use to do that? Because when you are sitting in an aeroplane and your eyes are closed, but you can't help it, there are two small movements of the eyes that you cannot stop. So there are a little ovals in the middle and there's a small circle in the middle, and when you try to follow the change of the two simple shapes, you do so for tens of thousands of milliseconds before you can get rid of them.'"

One is how, how the brain, how the brain calculates the distance from an object. The distance between the, the, the cursor in the computer monitor and the computer mouse, and calculates its, its position from the mouse click. Another one is how it calculates when the mouse starts to move after it touches the, the, um, the mouse. And then there's a third one, um, where the, the brain calculates when is the mouse to move.

I would say that the way the brain organization works is it's like a giant system of multiple parallel loops that goes in both directions. So that the feedforward loops which convey perceptions from the motor cortices to the association cortex and also their outputs to sensory cortices, and the feedback loops, which convey motor outputs from the association cortex back to the motor cortices where you can have a feedback signal going to the same areas that you just got a feedforward signal from. And these loops are not independent, you would never be able to do a computation or to explain to an intelligent being how to make a car, let's say, go around with a steering wheel. We can make anything with any steering, so when I think of the brain as a giant parallel loop, you understand that there is this very complex organization and a certain top-down orchestration.

I mean, let's say from the point of view of a particular neuron in which case, you would say that this is a goal that your neuron would pursue. And if you were not the only neuron, then it would not make sense that this is what a single neuron does for a long time. Because, for a goal, you need to be able to move forward. You have to move forward somewhere, or else you're simply stuck.   Then you could say, \"Now, in order to move from point to point in time, we need to go from here to here to here and to here again\" and such, and such a path is, you can call it a trajectory or a trajectory.   And the goal for the brain is just to produce trajectories that have the best performance.   How do you know what's the best?   Well, there's a natural answer.'"

That's the problem I have with the concept of function, is that there's no alternative, and it's really hard to say, okay, that happens to be the only function because that's just what it is. At the very least, in my mind, it has to have some other alternatives, as well, that it's doing something different, something else, just in case, should occur. Now, this is how we work in real practice, because we always go to the alternative, not to say, okay that's the only alternative function in the brain, or in the brain in general, but to say what is.

If the rat takes a particular direction in a maze, say left, then it fires when the rats head is to the left, but it does not respond when the rat turns right. Now the simple circuits of the hippocampus will respond to a particular direction only when the rats head remains in that direction. That's why they're called head-direction neurons. But in a higher-order-circuit, there's another circuit that can respond when the rat is on the periphery and the head is to the right.'"

The motor cortex, there's no question that the primary function of this area should be sending motor commands out, and there is no question about that, I guess. The other one is the association area, which we only recently discovered. They have a quite different function, one is sensory-based, but the other is motor-based. What is the difference?

And we haven't found, and I certainly don't think we're ever going to find it. The reason is very simple, which is that there is no, because cortical function is not the product of some single function. It's the product of, it's a product of a number of functions, which are brought about by a number of cell types, which have a number of different specializations, which then, then have a number of specializations by a particular level of organization.

So the important thing about the human brain is that it's organized to deal with problems.

The fundamentals are always simple, and the problems are always complicated. So this is where we're going. So now we have to see whether you agree with that or not.

But the other experiment is to make a cut through some deeper layers and you'll see how the connectivity goes from layer four to layer two in an eight-layer neocortex, which provides a lot of information, for example, about local connectivity, that it's a sheet-like network, that you can cut through the middle or the bottom, or even up to the top and have a sheet that is intact for many centimeters.'"

So, it appears now that memory is one primary function of the brain, and this is what we mean when we say that the brain has to do some processing before it can store anything. It has to make sure that the information that has been stored is there and available to be stored in a coherent way, so that a small fragment of information will cause the system to go to the same place the next time it comes to the question.'",

We have two systems in our brains that are devoted to navigation. One of them is used more frequently than the other one. Which one is it? We can choose, the one that has been used more is the current?one. And that's very easy now to say that the associational cortex is largely devoted to dealing with time.

It would be a sentence of many words, like a page or two, depending on how you count some of the words. But here's another way. Now, by definition, associational areas are devoted for a particular function, and the function is the brain activity that has a lot of overlap with another function, such as navigation, for example. Now, what is the critical part of the hippocampus, the critical part of this region, that would allow the hippocampal region to be responsible for the computation that's used when animals get their bearings, for example?'"

The thing that drives me absolutely crazy is this, that how we go from nothing to the world all of a, from no features to elements, from elements to words, and from words to, at this, to, to, and we get an order, a hierarchy, and then we have to be so careful to explain how they do, or we think they do. We can, we will, even if there's no explanation. There's no, well, we can do it.'",

It's called cognitive mapping. You know, people come to think about navigation in two different ways. We come either to think about it as route-based, or as path-based. With respect to route-based, our research has shown, using the way-finding task, that there is a fundamental difference, which I would describe it as fundamental, and which has implications for thinking about the human brain as well as that of small animals. One fundamental difference is that way-finding is solved in the rat by a hippocampus-dependent memory, whereas in humans, it is solved by a neocortex-dependent planning approach. They are solving the same problem, but human cognitive mapping has a much larger working memory.'",

We're seeing that the theta rhythm varies, even in the same brain, even in very short time windows, but this theta rhythm is often referred to as the \"presta-tive\" theta pattern. The theta waves are often present in a specific part of the hippocampus, and the theta is often present in a subset of the pyramidal cells, in the same brain region.

That's my kind of view of the brain. That would be the basis of hierarchical operations. There are a hierarchy of many networks interconnected from very large to very small, right?

And if you have three objects, in which those are not identical, your eye is going to notice the relationship between them, where they're dissimilar from one another, where they're similar to each other'. Therefore, what I would say is you need to have some additional information about the sequences in which the objects are embedded. But most of the time the brains default state is the same and what is important is the relations that occur.

I moved into physiology because in physiology I found the very small, just a couple of neurons, one, two, three, four. I wondered then, how a single neuron can make such an impact on its target cells, just by timing them. To make a difference, one neuron can affect so many others, and how different single neurons differ from each other.  And the answer was that that single neuron is a pacemaker, as is a single neuron in the limbic system. And that's pretty much what you think, right.'"

If you know, for example, that your mouse is facing to the left when there is a wheel to the left, or right when there is a ring on the right, and maybe to the left, and so on, then there shouldn't be a problem with it. That's just a set of motor commands in which the brain is embedded to solve the task. And there is no need for any regions that are dedicated to associations at this phase, because there is only one kind of movement, so the brain can kind of solve anything that it has to do at any given time pretty much efficiently without interference from the association areas, as long the movement does not conflict, as long as there is no conflict, because what you want me to do that I'm already doing?

The person responded and told me that, \"You know why there's something called memory is really important is due to the fact that if you have a memory that's an associational area and if you also have an associate area, you already have a hippocampus and in a memory area, where you have such a large collection of neurons, then you have an associational system and in an associational system, you have an association area.'",

So that is, in principle, where we would expect to find the highest level of integration in the brain. Now this is hard to explain because if you look at the brain, the higher layers of the brain are more connected than the lower layers. Now what may be critical to point out though is that there's a very large difference between the associational areas and the most highly interconnected areas that are in the most posterior layers of the cortex. And the reason for that is one of practical significance that is that those highly interconnected areas have a much easier way to communicate with each other than those with a higher degree of connectivity in the associational areas.'",

So the hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells and interneurons, together with their excitatory-inhibitory connections, can produce sequences of three events in a single theta cycle in a short time window. It is a very simple rule. All you have to do is to connect these three neurons, or this group of three neurons, together in such a way that they produce an output in about two theta cycles. You have a sequence of three, as compared to, say, four different events, which can take several theta cycles.

Now, I will start by saying that the question, perhaps the question should be... I'm curious... what would be a definition of the primary function of the brain? And the answer is: you know it when you see it. That would be a rather poor definition, wouldn't it? Because that's very similar to the definition of primary function given to me by... I'd call it a 'neural syntax' but most people would say a 'neural narrative' and we have to realize that the brain is a neural assembly and it is that simple. Everything else is secondary or derivative. Now, that's not to say that there aren't other aspects to it, like, or elements, but the brain is really a single continuous system.'",

What do you mean now by the \"continuous system\"? Now, the two fundamental principles of a continuous system are entropy balance and energy. And these two principles have opposing effects on the dynamic of a system. And as long as one of these two fundamental principles of the brain is... is kept in balance, then the network, or the system in question, would be called a'steady state'. And that's where things are the best. But what is an \"order parameter\"? Now, the order parameter is an indicator of the state of the system. You know, it will do a particularly well-understood or well-understood-ish thing. Now, what is that thing? A state.'",

It seems that the brain is very good in figuring out which level of the cortex or which kind of information to transmit to which structure, but in which case is not, is that if you really want to get some kind of a global operation, in other words, in which case, I have to say, we have to come up with one single algorithm, which will act in every single case.

One is, if that's indeed the primary mechanism in virtually any species, that means what kind of inputs do you have to send in order to make the cortex respond? and the other one is, whether the input does really need to be an explicit input for the cortical network, for example, whether the input of a stimulus requires the participation of the highest order cerebral cortex in order to represent the stimulus.

I think it is the best way to deal with that kind of complexity. It is an efficient thing for them to do. Otherwise, they would go to a smaller, more specific domain. Now, that last is a bit of an oversimplification. Many things can be going at the same time within the same structure. And even outside the same structure.

This is where the different systems of the cortex emerge. They arise separately and then combine together, and only then comes the so-called association areas. The association systems, as I show in my little book, have two different roles, and these are very different. The first, and the most important one, is the self-associative role. These cells receive the same inputs from the rest of the cortical areas and make a huge excitatory network of themselves, which then becomes one that may be called a higher order associational circuit. The second one, which is equally important, is where these areas are connected to other cortical areas, and these are, again, the associational sites, so they are different things.'"

And it's really an input area and very, very important, very efficient in sensing inputs from the environment. But what about the outputs of the parietal cortex?'",

The two streams, in my view, are memory and action. They are pretty much separated, and you had the frontal eye field and the cingulate cortex areas as the front end of the associational cortical areas.

A large fraction of the synaptic connection from cortex to CA3 and CA1 pyramidal cells and also to a smaller number of inhibitory neurons in the hippocampus is in the form of 'outputs', and these, of course, also originate in the hippocampal CA3 and CAI inputs [3]. My guess is that the primary function of the hippocampus, for the first 50,000 years, was as a feedforward excitatory device, and, of course, it can't perform that function when it acquires new features. The new features that emerged are the formation of new memories and cognitive functions that we have defined as complex behavior.'"
