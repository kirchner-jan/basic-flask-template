  "name": "The following is a transcript of a conversation between the two famous neuroscientists Dr. Buzsaki and Dr. Marder. Dr. Buzsaki's primary interests is 'neural syntax', i.e., how segmentation of neural information is organized by the numerous brain rhythms to support cognitive functions. Dr. Marder studies the dynamics of small neuronal networks, and her work was instrumental in demonstrating that neuronal circuits are not 'hard-wired' but can be reconfigured by neuromodulatory neurons and substances to produce a variety of outputs. The two are having a public academic panel discussion about the function of the higher-order-cortex.\n-BEGIN TRANSCRIPT-\n",

For many years we were working on a model of the brain that was based on the properties of the pyloric neurons in the PD (Pyloric Dilator) and LP (Lateral Pyloric) cells of the STG in the pyloric circuit. And we were trying to see if we could get the different circuits of neurons, neurons that are involved in brain processes, like emotion, to come in synchrony with each other. We didn't think that was possible. But we thought that we would be able to understand the brain by doing the measurements, getting single neurons, working with multiple neurons, that you've done so elegantly in your experiments.'",

So here is  a simple circuit, and it is the circuit that is connected to a motor neuron and the motor neuron's primary goal is to exert an action.  Now, this is simply a very simple circuit. It has only a motor neuron. It does not have any intermediate or higher-order-layer neurons, and so it requires that the activity of the interneurons be maintained synchronously and they are in the right time window. But here is  a more complicated circuit, where the two main goals of the lower-order-layer and the higher-order neurons and  the inhibitory interneurons are maintained synchronously.'",

And all connections, including the brain connections, are based on the connection of the nerves. The connection of the nerves is based on the activity of the spinal cord, which is a giant mass of uncoordinated neurons. But how would uncoordinated neurons connect to each other?'",

If you ever look through a microscope in the brain, you will be amazed about the complexity of the neuron types. The cell type that is closest to the general rule is the layer 6 neuron, which can be called pyramidal neuron in the frontal cortex of the mouse. Those neurons are so simple that they have five branches. At the base of each ramification, the bouton is packed with excitatory postsynaptic chemical receptors, which allows my neighbors to talk to me. In my lab, I have trained a lot of students what is a layer 6 pyramidal cell. Our students are good at these simple-cell-type tasks. Many of them, like myself, are interested in more complex neuronal functions. But there are very big problems. For example, how should they deal with these neurons and how would they know them?'",

My first observation is that if you put a mouse with a group of mice and let it live, the activity in its brain changes because the animal has to respond to its own body. As a mouse starts with a basal level of activity, like it gets to wake up in the light or it gets frightened by some noise, one or two or three or four of these things, this animal might spend all day running around and looking for small targets and chewing the lumps off of sticks for no significant purpose. Once it starts having to deal with itself, then you start getting more and more of this kind of activity as the animal gets used to controlling its own movement in the brain. This may or may not lead the animal to begin to realize that it has purposeful abilities beyond being a small mouse living in some hole. It may not.'",

Well, one of the functions of the association areas on in the mouse cortex is to provide for electrical coupling between neurons. So, all of the cortical neurons are electrically coupled to each other through an extensive network of the associated ganglia, through the stomatogastric nerve. So, there is electrical coupling between all of these nervous systems. So, you're giving me electrical coupling, so to allow electrical conduction to take place from cell to cell in a network, and back up to the brain. So, and these are two different mechanisms, that are different types of electrical coupling, and may serve slightly different purposes in the network in some aspects.

And that is the fundamental mechanism of electrical coupling. So when we go back to the question of the primary motivation? The primary motivation for this electric coupling is to allow for electrical communication with a charged group of electrically charged molecules. Not electrically charged molecules, but electrically charged molecules between those electrically charged molecules to have electromagnetic communication. Again. So, what is our motivation? What is the primary goal that we're looking to achieve? We have a variety of different, electrical connections between neurons and glial cells in the brain.'",

Perception in humans has changed and evolved over time. In fact, a couple of years ago we looked at a study and we found that humans of different races show differences in perception. So for example African-Americans tend to be better at perception than the other races. Whites and Americans. So we were interested in seeing whether maybe the same thing is happening in a laboratory monkey. So we tested whether monkeys in the laboratory could perceive and behave appropriately as their species did in their normal environments. We found they couldn't.'",

Some mice have one or two small areas -you know, I think the largest one is, like, a little island and then it's smaller than that island in both direction. So that's it. But if you use, you know, if you create these mice with the single-cell-type neuron, then you are essentially generating these network models with a one kind of neuron. And it's really hard to do that, you know because then you have all the complexities of the networks that you want from them, and you also have your single-cell-neuron properties. So in some cases it's simpler to have one or two, you know, maybe three neuron types. So that's the case that I know is, like, simpler in that sense.'",

It's very good that you ask me this question, because you are not the only one to ask this question. Every day we get people ask us about the role of different network features, other than the network itself, because it is very clear that a network can have different sets of rules that give it different functions. So now, I believe the primary purpose of those association networks is to provide the information-processing capabilities that are required for the development of thought and behaviour. So I think that the primary purpose of many of those features in the cortex, besides supporting the activity that is required for the functions of neural activity, is to generate information, to produce synaptic connections, to maintain synaptic connections, to activate, to regulate and to inhibit and to coordinate the neural activity throughout the brain.'",

I feel that the function of inhibition is to select, to limit and to control the activity of the neural assembly. And the cortex is such a great example of this, where inhibition can select whether the activity will be amplified or reduced (or the primary function is to divide) and it can limit the activity of a network, but when the brain itself is providing the inhibition, that activity becomes an amplifier that can regulate the activity of the network. So in a way, that inhibition has a dual function: to divide and to amplify and combine the activity.'",

And also in any nervous system there are often different network configurations. So in a neural network, as well as neurons, you find there will be networks that have either a number of single neurons that have a single cell excitation, or they have a number of different neurons that are firing. And it is necessary for the circuit to remain intact that all those neurons inhibit each neuron at a rate that is appropriate to the time constants of the network, so that the network can fire either a tonic rhythm, or a normal rhythm, where it maintains an appropriate timing to facilitate behaviour. So it is necessary to have a functional inhibitory network, and I do think the primary purpose is to be functional.

I think in any kind of circuit, whether it's a neuronal circuit or a circuit of muscles, there is always a central coordinating hub, and it's important to ensure that this hub receives enough inhibitory as well as electrical input from all of the other elements in the circuit. It might think that we could get away with a simple hub that simply inhibits all neurons, or if we were studying invertebrates where there're only one brain, we could try and get away with a hub that inhibits all the neurons.

So, that's a different role, an independent role, from your muscle contraction. Or it could be a different role of a muscle contraction. So it can be completely separate. So, your muscles can contract independently and they lift your jaw and your teeth, for example, on a diet.

I think there's plenty of work saying the connectivity isn't perfect, but it's much better than random. Even randomness as a circuit would be dangerous because these different neurons have different properties, and if they do not all develop very closely coordinated behavior they could be dangerous for each other, and so forth. But my feeling is that each neuron develops its own property. One has an axonal projection to another neuron, has electrical synapses to other neurons, has other electrical synapses, has its own conductances.'",

Because again, there is no right answer on that. You know. So, there's this question, when should I stand and when should I run, and this stuff goes on, and you have to think about it.

For example, the glutamatergic synapse on the pyloric pacemaker (PG) neurons, and the synapse of the anterior pyloric neuron from LP to the PG and to PY.

But it's because of this internalized action that you have this, this internally produced brain dynamics, that there are certain patterns of activity that occur. And these patterns of activity are being released because the brain is doing, it's always doing something. And you can call that, call those internalized brain states, like the hippocampus, enthrasis, attention, and what not. So by looking at it from this angle, then there are always neuronal changes and their consequences across these states and their boundaries. And that, uh, that could be the function of the cortex as a whole.'",

The first objective you'd have to do is you'd probably need to find some way to label these neurons so you could find individual neurons, and so on and explore these different features of them, which will tell you how they're wired and how the function is likely to use them. And I think we're kind of close to being able to do that in a very systematic way, given what we know about connectivity, the synaptic connections, the neurotransmitters, using genetic techniques as well as electrophysiological approaches, and a variety of biochemical experiments and so on.'",

But you look back and you think, oh [the] guy  is a friend [or] stranger, and it makes it possible for you to interact with a wider network of people.

But it seems to be the case that circuits are intrinsically, that they behave intrinsically as units, so even though you may have 10 neurons connected, in many cases, you'll know, maybe, 5 of them are actually going to contribute to some action because the others are kind of silent.

So many times in biology it's the case where we know you have this part of the cell, and we know that it is important for the function, but we don't necessarily know exactly how it is used by the cell. A large example is with synaptic inhibitory activity in animals and humans. The synaptic activity of inhibitory synapses is important for muscle contraction or muscle contraction, but not for muscle relaxation. It can also provide the inhibition to the gastric mill rhythm, which is essential for digestion. Right? So the nervous system uses a variety of electrical synapses to maintain function. It uses it to keep the rhythms alive, it uses it to modulate or change the properties of neurons, and that's why it really is so important.'",

You have to work together, and you have to work in time, which is perhaps a fundamental thing that we still haven't solved. Of course, there would be a lot of reasons to solve if the neural syntax would be known. And the way that it would be solved is if we would have a good idea of what information the neurons are communicating in their spikes and how they are being transmitted. Right? That would allow us to do computer-assisted searches and find out in which direction the neurons are firing, and this would let the brain work out what is required.

The way that is it is happening in the hippocampus, which is a complex, complex system, but it's a synchronized population of neurons. And when you are looking at many neuronal assemblies in this small population, they are sending a different set of messages that the other neurons are receiving. And there are these very critical mechanisms that allow those messages to be processed. It's probably similar in the cerebral cortex. And the messages are also being processed.

And we have neurons that do not have axons, and neurons that do not connect to any other cell. And we can connect through different kinds of synapses, even among other neurons in the network. So, we are seeing very different kinds of connectivity among different cells. So, I am, by extension, assuming that the primary purpose of these connections is to provide new kinds of functionality. Not only to ensure connectivity, necessarily, but to provide new kinds functionality.'",

But neurons, by definition, are found in both the nervous system and the periphery, so that can provide independent checks about how robust the system should be. I think my main concern is not to do it in principle, because it's certainly possible to do, but to provide a picture because we understand the brain. That's the issue. We want to understand how the brain works and understand how it's connected to other parts and how it makes decisions and solves problems.

Or the primary function of this cortex is to provide and to provide inputs to the hippocampus. And, you know, of course these were much shorter time scales and we knew less about the brain. And so, but now we understand a little bit more, but what do you make of these ideas that the higher order cortex may just be a homeostatic regulator of the lower order-fusion.'",

But for a really long time, it was believed that neurons were very very stereotyped, that they were found in one circuit, they all had specific sets of synapses and so on. And then there were also people saying that you know you can't use neurons that are identical in a way to infer synaptic function. You can't use identical neurons to infer a synaptic function. If you just look at the synaptic connections of neurons, you won't find anything, right? Because you know they could be coupled to one another, and each one might have a different set of synaptic connections.'",

And then we started to go down as far as to look at the different neuronal elements and their connectivity. And it turns out like, especially in these model organisms, like, when you look at the mouse and the drosophila stomatogastric ganglion (STG), and it's only got like seven neurons in the STG. So you know it's got like three pacemaker neurons.
