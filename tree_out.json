  "name": "The following is a transcript of a conversation between the two famous neuroscientists Dr. Buzsaki and Dr. Marder. Dr. Buzsaki's primary interests is 'neural syntax', i.e., how segmentation of neural information is organized by the numerous brain rhythms to support cognitive functions. Dr. Marder studies the dynamics of small neuronal networks, and her work was instrumental in demonstrating that neuronal circuits are not 'hard-wired' but can be reconfigured by neuromodulatory neurons and substances to produce a variety of outputs. The two are having a public academic panel discussion about the function of the higher-order-cortex.\n-BEGIN TRANSCRIPT-\n",

I mean, the limbic system has long associations with things like emotional states and decision-making and all those things, but it does not have a function within the limbic areas, as I would call it, but that's because the whole point of the limbic system is whether or not an effect should be initiated.'",

The auditory sensory network has all kinds. The sensory integration network, the auditory network has all kinds, because you know, the retina and the pylorus, all these muscles have their own individual functions that are not necessarily for moving the body, because those muscles are used by the muscles, and all the muscles that move in the body. So, you know, I think the, if you wanna have a network of many different regions of different neurons that are network in themselves and can generate activity on their own and be integrated with the other regions of the network, I mean, it's possible that that network can generate its own actions.

The neurons are distinct. They are distinct because they have their own electrical properties, they're distinct in many biochemical properties but, uh, they also send electrical, uh, electrical information to each other. So we're back, so to the past, but it was clear early on that neurons could contribute substantially to many different neuronal circuits so that's what the association area is for, for, uh, to help you with electrical transmission.

And there are, uh, two ways to look at it. One is a, so there's, uh, the first, uh, way of looking at the question is that, uh, if you are looking at the history of brain rhythms, then one can only feel sorry for the lack of a good answer.

So many times in biology it's the case where we know you have this part of the cell, and we know that it is important for the function, but we don't necessarily know exactly how it is used by the cell. A large example is with synaptic inhibitory activity in animals and humans. The synaptic activity of inhibitory synapses is important for muscle contraction or muscle contraction, but not for muscle relaxation. It can also provide the inhibition to the gastric mill rhythm, which is essential for digestion. Right? So the nervous system uses a variety of electrical synapses to maintain function. It uses it to keep the rhythms alive, it uses it to modulate or change the properties of neurons, and that's why it really is so important.'",

You have to work together, and you have to work in time, which is perhaps a fundamental thing that we still haven't solved. Of course, there would be a lot of reasons to solve if the neural syntax would be known. And the way that it would be solved is if we would have a good idea of what information the neurons are communicating in their spikes and how they are being transmitted. Right?

But\u2014of course, there is always the important problem, and that is the problem of how does this\u2014you know, how does this integration of many neurons really happen, and how does it occur, and it's probably not the same in every brain, and it's also probably the consequence of evolution.

And when you are looking at many neuronal assemblies in this small population, they are sending a different set of messages that the other neurons are receiving. And there are these very critical mechanisms that allow those messages to be processed. It's probably similar in the cerebral cortex. And the messages are also being processed. All these issues must be dealt with when we are thinking about how to understand the function of the brain as it is now.

The context is the brain's ability to manipulate the hippocampus to extract different details of a situation depending upon where it occurs. For instance, if a mouse is in the home cage during the hours of darkness, when there are many sensory systems being active, and if it is only during the hours of light, when the hippocampus is active in many ways, then it would be perfectly logical also to say that the hippocampus deals with local decisions.'",

So we found that these neurons that fire with this pattern change over time, during development, during time that the brain changes because the nervous system changes, and in fact, they go through phases where they have more of one kind of oscillator over time and they cycle back and forth.

To eat, you got to have muscles move, so how does it do that? But the association neurons are used to drive muscle movements. So what do they do? They drive muscle movements. I think that is a critical function. It is clear you see these kinds of connections between neurons, which we know occur in all animals all the time. We know that all neurons are electrically coupled. We know that these neurons influence and/or are influenced by all other kinds of neurons in the system.'"

But you know, it's difficult to actually say what the consequences of an alteration on brain operation will be because so many experiments depend on this kind of in vitro preparations. How many experiments you are willing to undertake that would depend solely on these conditions without involving the brain. There is no reason to believe that your answers would be applicable to the brain in its  in vivo  state. So as far as we can evaluate the consequences... it's more efficient to go in and look at what happens in the brain when the primary function takes place. So that's what the first thing we do. I would assume that this is the default operation in the brain.'"
